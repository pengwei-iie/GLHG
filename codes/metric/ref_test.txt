[Questions] How are you feeling?
[Self-disclosure] I understand. I have been feeling the same way lately -- my family has been distracted and stressed and it's rubbing off on me. Are there other people around that you can spend time with?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand. It seems to me that much of what makes the holidays worthwhile is the opportunity to spend time with people we care about. It makes sense that you would have a hard time celebrating with nobody there to share it with you.
[Questions] Are you close with your family these days?
[Providing Suggestions] (even if you don't talk to them much, do you think it would be worth reaching out to them?)
[Other] I see.
[Questions] Do you remember enjoying the holidays more when your kids were younger?
[Questions] I see. Do you know what has changed? You said that the teenagers are more interested in getting presents than actually celebrating the holiday itself. Is that a major reason? What about your husband?
[Questions] I see. You are frustrated with them because of the way they have been behaving. What do you think they should be doing differently?
[Questions] (also, are you in a state where they have closed down the schools?)
[Other] Oh, that's okay. :)
[Self-disclosure] Something i tend to struggle with is the way things change over time, when they can never go back to the way they were before. When my sisters and i were little, it seemed like everything in the world was so much simpler, and we had certain christmas traditions that we always looked forward to, like cutting down a tree, making pumpkin pie, and singing carols and christmas hymns together. As we've gotten older it seems like our family has gotten split apart a bit more and everyone is too stressed and hurried to enjoy the old things that we used to do. That has been pretty hard for me because things used to be so much different. Has that been difficult for you, as well? Just the fact that things are different now than when your kids were little.
[Self-disclosure] I don't have kids, no. I am still a kid, sort of. :)
[Other] Also i've got a bad cold right now, which is why it's taking me a bit longer to respond as well.
[Other] Thank you for talking! Oh, one thing--
[Other] Can i write you a christmas card? If you would rather not give me your name/address, i understand.
[Other] Okay. Who should i address it to?
[Other] Oh, right. Okay. Good night and merry christmas!
[Questions] I do not blame you. Would you like to tell me what specifically is bad about it for you?
[Reflection of feelings] So you just feel as though there is nothing to look forward to at the moment?
[Self-disclosure] I have to admit that i have been feeling much this way myself. It has been a very long year, hasn't it?
[Self-disclosure] There is the new year to look forward to. It might bring new things - there might be a vaccine, for instance.
[Reflection of feelings] So you feel that there are a lot of ignorant people out there who are making things worse by refusing to follow the rules?
[Self-disclosure] All we can really do is to follow the rule ourselves and so help to make things better for people!
[Questions] That must feel very difficult for you. Do you have anyone around who can support you, even if just by leaving groceries outside of your door?
[Reflection of feelings] I think that some people simply do not have much in the way of current sense. Is it true to say that this is making things worse for you?
[Other] common sense, sorry.
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] That must be incredibly difficult for you. I gather your husband is not with you right now. How long have you been separated for?
[Questions] Hiya! =) How are you doing, today?
[Questions] I totally understand that. Which year are you in?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh goodness, i can't imagine how stressful that would be. I've only gotten my associates, and i found that last semester to be a slough. But what kept me going was the relief and joy i would feel once i had that diploma in hand.
[Other] Are there any study groups or classmates you can get together with, and basically make a night of it?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Very true, this year made everyone's expectations and plans go out the window lol
[Providing Suggestions] It might be time to put yourself out of your comfort zone, but start small. Are there any clubs or groups associated with your major? That way, you have some common ground to work with.
[Providing Suggestions] That sounds like a good idea =) Even if you can't hold club meetings on campus or have any gatherings, maybe they hold their meetings over video calls. One plus side to that, is that you don't need to have your camera on to participate.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] That's understandable, especially with how the past year has been. Everyone is on edge and everything feels so uncertain, but that's okay, because you're not alone =)
[Affirmation and Reassurance] You said you're doing well so far? Take pride in that, and focus on that. "if i've been doing well so far, i must be doing something right. I'll just keep doing what i have been, and everything should work out in the end."
[Self-disclosure] We can be our own worst critics, and that's never been truer than when we're facing a challenge. Self-doubt can be such a pain, but when i find i'm having trouble believing in myself and working toward my goals, i'll focus on what i already accomplished, and that helps give me that extra push to keep going
[Other] I might be an internet stranger, but i'm proud of you, too. =) You've got one and a half semesters to go! You've got this! I believe in you! <3
[Other] You're very welcome, i'm glad i could help =)
[Questions] How are you this evening?
[Questions] Are you someone who has immune issues?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Just to clarify, you are extremely anxious about the pandemic and the affect it may have on you because of your weakened immune system.
[Reflection of feelings] Just from the few messages we have exchanged, i can tell it makes you very anxious
[Providing Suggestions] Have you reached out to support groups for people with auto-immune issues? it is often helpful to speak with people who are experiencing the same issues you are.
[Providing Suggestions] Have you talked to him about the way he reacts to your immune issues? Sometimes people don't realize they are not being helpful and they think they are doing good when they aren't.
[Providing Suggestions] Have you asked what his feelings are towards it? Maybe he is afraid and worried about your health and he isn't sure how to express it and sometimes it comes off as uninterested.
[Questions] Have you been able to talk to your kids about this as well?
[Other] Yea, with young kids it is hard to tell sometimes
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I know this is extremely hard, but i know you can make it through this!
[Questions] I'm doing really well, thanks. What brings you here today?
[Self-disclosure] I can appreciate that. Thinking about lost loves makes me sad too!
[Questions] What about this particular relationship makes you feel sad?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Oh...i see, you think s/he's the "one who got away?"
[Questions] Why did you break up?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Wow...that does sound painful.
[Self-disclosure] I know how hard it is to let go of a guy you really loved. I've had to break up with a few of them over the years!
[Self-disclosure] In the long run, i feel that those break-ups were absolutely necessary. I'm in a really good place now. And they are too.
[Providing Suggestions] I eventually learned to think of it like this: every man i loved taught me something important about myself. And i taught them things about themselves. And it doesn't happen overnight. But eventually, you will probably be able to see how you grew as a result of the breakup.
[Providing Suggestions] Maybe the things you will learn can help you be ready for mr right!
[Other] That's a really good way of looking at it.
[Other] Oohh.... I think it really depended on how long i was with them. And why i decided to end it. The longer relationships maybe a few weeks to a few months before i was ready to move on and try again. But only a fraction of that was crying with ben & Jerry's!
[Providing Suggestions] For me it just happened that one day, i thought about gary and i didn't really feel that sad anymore. I just thought...wow, we had some good times.
[Providing Suggestions] B&j's and a few good rom-coms ought to put you in a better mood! Lol
[Other] It really sounds like you are making progress!
[Providing Suggestions] Just remember the old saying "time heals all wounds."
[Other] It's my pleasure! I hope you keep feeling stronger!
[Other] You know, i believe you!
[Questions] hi! how are you doing?
[Questions] i'm so sorry to hear that. how long has this been going on?
[Other] thatâ€™s understandable
[Information] i had to refresh, its woudn't take any of my text!
[Questions] when is the deadline?
[Questions] for your masters? doctorate?
[Questions] are you on campus or having to do everything remotely?
[Reflection of feelings] what is causing you the most anxiety, the deadline or fear taht you wont be able to meet it?
[Information] most campuses here have gone online. my son is doing his classes remotely and my husband works for a university and is working from home - i can imagine campus is very quiet
[Providing Suggestions] have you written out a timeline and posted it somewhere you can see it? i find that helps me with projects
[Questions] aww you're sweet. it's just something that i find helpful. has covid made collecting data more challenging for you?
[Other] that's good. stay safe!
[Other] yes
[Providing Suggestions] you have the tools at hand to finish your task, but you also have a lot of unusual distractions. you will be fine
[Providing Suggestions] you wouldn't have been accepted into your program if they didn't think you could handle it
[Questions] What would you like to talk to me about today?
[Self-disclosure] Unfortunately i think that a lot of people are trying to find online work right now as people are too scared to go out - i know that i am!
[Providing Suggestions] It can be very good yes. Have you tried any other sort of gig work?
[Other] Oh wow, that is really bad. At least there aren't very many people there .. I think it's mainly research people.
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you feel that perhaps you could make some money by vlogging?
[Other] I think it would be fun to visit but not for very long.
[Providing Suggestions] Well, perhaps you could vlog about the need to wear facemasks?
[Information] Yes it is! Beware that there are a lot of people trying to make money on youtube though - you need to get lucky.
[Other] It's a difficult time for us all :) People are doing what they have to in order to put food on their tables i think.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I am hopeful that with the vaccine having been developed, things might start to improve shortly.
[Providing Suggestions] Can you think of things to look forward to in the new year that might cheer you up a little?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, maybe the change of administration in some parts of the world will help a little.
[Other] I mean that political change can help people and give them fresh hope. Or, depress them :)
[Other] That would be a big help for people who are struggling!
[Questions] Christmas is a good time of year but it is also expensive. Do you think that it has increased your financial woes?
[Other] I am glad to hear that .. too many people think they have to spend too much. Anyway i hope you have had a lovely day and all the best to you
[Other] And you!
[Questions] I am okay thanks but it is a worrying year. Have you been worrying about anything?
[Questions] Ah i hear you, i have been self isolating too. Do you have an online support network?
[Self-disclosure] Well, friends you can talk to during this difficult time? I have a lot of friends on facebook and similar that i can talk to.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Sometimes it does just make it easier to know that other people are in the same situation as you :)
[Providing Suggestions] Yes .. or at least share coping mechanisms perhaps?
[Providing Suggestions] Do you have any hobbies that you can occupy yourself with right now?
[Questions] Could you perhaps set up zoom meetings where you could play together online?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] No i don't think so :) I think that it is totally live so you could play just as you would if you were together in person.
[Other] I hope it goes well for you. It has been such an awful year, hasn't it?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I wish you all the very best for 2021. I hope that you get to get together with your band again and rock!
[Other] Yes, all we need to do is be patient! Have a great new year and thanks for talking.
[Other] I am great. Is anything bothering you today?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] You seem very concerned about this. It seems quite unfair! How do you feel about helping the other engineer?
[Reflection of feelings] I understand how stressful this must feel to you. Sounds like you are a great experienced worker, but they want to use your expertise instead to train the inexperienced worker.
[Providing Suggestions] I understand that. I think you have a legitimate complaint. Maybe go to upper management and make it more like a concern than a complaint? If you word it right, they will believe that you really care about your job (i can tell that you really do). I am sure they don't want to lose you.
[Reflection of feelings] You are right. I feel your anxiety in this. Competition is high in all industries right now it seems.
[Providing Suggestions] Maybe sign up with those employment sites online. Indeed, ziprecuiter, etc...it can't hurt to see what other options are out there.
[Self-disclosure] Wow that sounds super interesting. You have nothing to lose going to upper management though with your concern. I have been in management and when employees came to me with concerns and showed me how much they cared about their job to take the time to bring me their input.
[Reflection of feelings] I understand that. Freelance does equal freedom. Research opportunities. You sound like a smart man.
[Reflection of feelings] How does moving to wa. seem at this time? Boeing is an amazing company.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Advertising. Sounds like you have options. Hang tight for the next few months and see where the world is headed. Time are so uncertain right now, but hey, it can only get better from here.
[Other] You too, happy holidays. More importantly, happy new year!
[Affirmation and Reassurance] You got that right!
[Questions] Who do you see online?
[Providing Suggestions] What did he drop on you?
[Questions] Can you block notifications for him?
[Information] How long ago did he stop it?
[Providing Suggestions] If you block him and he wants to get in touch, he will find a way. Make him work hard
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] I think if he is interested still it will, if not his loss.
[Providing Suggestions] With him, or a relationship with someone?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Have you tried making other connections online? A lot of people are home during this pandemic, you may meet someone much better.
[Providing Suggestions] Keep busy! Get mad instead of sad!
[Providing Suggestions] I would not contact him if he was not contacting me. You deserve better than that!
[Providing Suggestions] Yes, we women function better when we get pissed!
[Reflection of feelings] Play it cool and be ready to make up a whole bunch of fun things you have been doing.
[Other] Of course you can!
[Information] You may find your feelings have changed. Sometimes we just want what we don't have, lol.
[Other] You are welcome. Stay strong, you are stronger than you think.
[Questions] I'm so sorry to hear that. How is that affecting you?
[Questions] I'm so sorry to hear that. How is that affecting you?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] I'm so sorry that you feel sad about the situation.
[Questions] What makes you think you are neglecting other important aspects in your life?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] That sounds difficult. You sound like a strong person still persevering in your masters even through this difficult time even if you can't pay attention as closely as before.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I remember a bad breakup too where i wasn't sure how the future would go. It can be scary not knowing what will come. It sounds like having a master's degree can really help you be independent though.
[Self-disclosure] I had to repeat a class and it took an extra year to finish my graduate school. The feeling of accomplishment and grit i developed made a huge difference though in my future abilities to cope with major stresses. You too will come out stronger.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] That sounds like a great plan. You sound like a very motivated person getting a masters degree is so difficult and you are working toward it. You will do well. I wish you all the best.
[Questions] Perhaps there is a counselor at school that could help you with reworking through some of your goals?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] There may be other students as well who are going through the same things as you that you could chat with.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Absolutely. I think things will turn around for you. You have a lot going for you and are very intelligent.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Things will get better with time. Keep pursuing your dreams
[Questions] Is there anything else i can help you with?
[Questions] Hello, what can i help today?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry to hear that, when did it happen?
[Questions] It must be heart broken for you. Have you talked to each other at all after it happend?
[Other] Did you talk to your friends about this? Maybe they can offer some advice as they know you best
[Affirmation and Reassurance] It is understandable to feel that way. I agree it's best to move out, you won't be able to move on if you still see each other. Have you considered seeing a therapist?
[Other] I suggest reaching out to your friends and try to distract yourself with activities that you want but haven't been able to do
[Reflection of feelings] Having a dog as companion right now is perfect. If you can, take your dog on a short trip somewhere, preferably in the nature
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I agree,i think how you look at the situation is important. Yes it's terrible, no one dares to say this is a blessing event. However, you can look at it differently, this is your chance to live for yourself and improve as a person
[Other] I'm glad i could help
[Other] you too!
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] I'm sorry to hear this. When did your boyfriend break up with you?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Breakups always hurt. They can be very painful, how long were you together?
[Reflection of feelings] It's very sad and your emotions will take a toll, but you have to set some goals so you don't fall into a funk. Do you have a good support system?
[Questions] Did he give a reason for the breakup?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Are you telling me he just said "i am breaking up with you" then never said why and left?
[Questions] I think he doesn't know what he wants and thinks the grass is greener on the other side of the fence. It is disrespectful to you. And hurtful. You say you have no support, don't you have friends? Family?
[Providing Suggestions] I think you might want to join an online support group then. Do you have any goals or aspirations that you are working on apart from your relationship? Because it will be painful to move forward, but if you have some goals, that can help you from falling into a slump.
[Self-disclosure] You are welcome. I am happily married now, but i had my fair share of breakups. They hurt my self esteem. I had to work hard to not let that happen. And do my best to grieve, but not get stuck there.
[Self-disclosure] If a man did not want to be with me, i took it hard as rejection, but in the long run, if he does not want to be with me, i don't want to be with him, but that takes time, and you need friends to encourage you.
[Other] Thank you. I'm older, been through a lot of hard knocks. You will be stronger too, right now you are hurting, in time you will see more clearly.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] He hasn't told you why, so the problem lies in him, not you. So do your best not to be hard on yourself. It is a shock to you now, but he never even communicated this with you over time, and he should have. that's what you want in a partner.
[Information] If a relationship has problems, you want someone to talk about he problems and work on them and grow as two people. He chose to walk away, that's immature and not what you want in a relationship. That is actually abusive.
[Self-disclosure] Thank you! You are so very kind! And you are very sweet too, willing to hear the truth! That is an admirable quality! You deserve a partner willing to work on problems, not a quitter.
[Other] Do take care of yourself! Find some friends, work hard at that, call old friends too. Just to say hi, call an old aunt or uncle and check in. Find community. That will help you.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes! Don't hop into another relationship for a long time, months, even a year. Find out who you are. Be the woman you want to be. I prayed for my husband for a long time. God is good! :d i had a lot of bad ones before him!
[Other] Thank you so much!
[Questions] hello, how are you?
[Questions] Do you want to tell me what happened?
[Questions] Is there a reason for you to think that way?
[Other] First of all, try not to overthink right now and do your best to review your materials
[Reflection of feelings] hmm i understand your frustration, have you talked to your professor about this?
[Reflection of feelings] I'm so sorry you were treated that way, it's unacceptable
[Other] How about teaching assistant or your friends? You can form a study group and i've found friends can help even more than teachers
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh no don't worry about that,i believe they are understanding and as long as you ask nicely, they'll be more than glad to help you
[Other] Yeah, the problem with teachers is they usually don't see from students' perspective while your fellow students do
[Self-disclosure] There are a few free online website that can provide help too, i used to check khan academy for concepts i don't understand
[Other] at the same time, you need to make time to relax too, you don't want to overwhelm yourself before the test
[Other] of course, i hope i could help a bit
[Questions] May i know what is wrong?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like it must be stressful to be locked in all day with children.
[Questions] Does the weather allow you to go outside while social distancing?
[Providing Suggestions] It may be beneficial to take walks.
[Reflection of feelings] It must be hard to ensure they get a good education when it is long distance learning.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I think you are doing a great job despite the challenges.
[Information] It may be hard to get, but sunlight is important for our moods. I hope you can find a moment or two to breathe when you can.
[Other] I don't have kids, but i have a dog who makes me go for walks, and it helps :)
[Providing Suggestions] I know many people have started adopting animals due to the lockdowns. I don't know if a pet would make you more or less crazy
[Other] Animals can provide a lot of stress relief. I would say it's their cozy fur, but lizards and fish have their own attributes :)
[Affirmation and Reassurance] A puppy sounds like a great idea. I think she or he will revitalize your family!
[Other] I've always wanted a nicely decorated fish tank. I'm glad you have pets to help you get through the day.
[Questions] Is it late where you are? Getting enough sleep helps our moods as well.
[Other] I think i just might. You've convinced me!
[Affirmation and Reassurance] That certainly must be tricky to do with 4 kids.
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] so you are scared your friend will get mad at you for buying your wife a car after he came asking for money from you? is that correct?
[Questions] Have you talked to him recently?
[Questions] Has he said anything about the car?
[Questions] do you think he is mad at you?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i know this can be a tough situation but i believe this situation will pass and everything will be ok between you to
[Self-disclosure] do not let this stress you out or worry that he is mad everything will be ok
[Providing Suggestions] i would suggest asking him if he saw your post about the car and ask him if he is mad about it
[Providing Suggestions] If you are comfortable enough facing him then ask him. Just do not force yourself if you are not comfortable doing that.
[Information] if you are more comfortable texting him then i would suggest doing that but i would not just say nothing about you buying the car you should just let him know.
[Reflection of feelings] I know how you are feeling about that
[Providing Suggestions] just try one of my suggestions and see what the result will be.
[Other] i am really sure the situation will be solved
[Other] i hope i helped you today.
[Providing Suggestions] yes he will
[Other] bye
[Questions] I'm so sorry to hear that. Was there any reasons that lead to the decision?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I feel you, it's scary to not be with the person you love so suddenly, especially during holiday
[Affirmation and Reassurance] However, from what you told me, it's no longer fit for you two to be together as your views are opposite. Maybe this is for the better
[Reflection of feelings] You can plan to spend the holiday with your friends or family instead. We are usually busy and neglect the most important people. This is the time to take care of that
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand. You made the right decision, if not now you will get in even more arguments in the future. He is just not the right person
[Other] Spend the time now that you have on yourself too. Be an even better version of you
[Reflection of feelings] That's the right attitude. With the right person, you learn what you like. With the wrong person, you learn what to avoid
[Self-disclosure] No i have not, but i have someone ghosted on my before. It hurt and actually helps me realize who cares and serious about me
[Other] Yeah, it took me quite a long time to break it off, and i'm glad i did. I'm glad you decided to call it off with your ex too, it's not an easy decision
[Reflection of feelings] you too, it's very nice talking to you
[Questions] Hi, i'm vicky! I'm doing pretty well :) How can i help you through your issues today?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] No problem! I would love to be a listening ear for you to talk about it and work through anything stuck in your mind.
[Self-disclosure] omgsh i'm so sorry to hear that. Is this your daughter's partner? I've been in an emotionally abusive relationship before and know how difficult it can be
[Affirmation and Reassurance] From my personal experience, i can say that your support really means everything to her. She may not want to admit the truth to herself, but with your support, i believe she can find the strength to get out of the relatioship
[Providing Suggestions] Yes i completely understand. It's a very delicate situation. I've read multiple times that it takes an average of 7 times to leave an abusive relationship (even though i think i tried even more times than that). She will hopefully one day gather the courage to realize she doesn't deserve to be treated badly
[Affirmation and Reassurance] You are amazing for being her support!
[Affirmation and Reassurance] That's seriously great to hear! I don't know what the exact situation is but i do know that she needs all the love she can get
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] that's all you can do for now until the day that she will be able to take steps to leave the bad situation
[Other] I hope that this will be a productive visit from them. At the very least, they'll be able to see what real love looks like from you guys :)
[Other] I'm so happy to hear that. I would love to help anyone i can to get out of an abusive relationship because it was the darkest period of my whole life. I wish you the best of luck and merry christmas!
[Other] I think you have to end the conversation on your end.
[Other] <3 agreed. Unconditional support is everything.
[Questions] How are you today?
[Other] I am sorry to hear you are not doing do good. Can you tell me how this feeling came about?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] It seems as if you may have some doubt and may feel unwanted and because of this you feel sad.
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Does this sound correct?
[Other] Yes.
[Self-disclosure] I have been were you are right now and i know you may be hurting at the moment.
[Questions] What is ot you feel you may be missing?
[Other] it*
[Reflection of feelings] You mentioned you feel sad and unloved but you have a good family. Do you feel as if you lack a good support systems within your family?
[Self-disclosure] No, not any more. I have to reflect on what was causes my feelings to be so negative and i corrected them.
[Reflection of feelings] From listening to you it seems as if you love your family and they also love and for sure want nothing but the best for you. The only thing is, is what's best for them seems like it is not best for you. What would you say?
[Other] Hello?
[Other] I am good how are you
[Questions] How was your career path different?
[Reflection of feelings] I understand how you are feeling everything will be okay
[Information] She did not like your career path?
[Other] If anything she was supposed to support whatever career path you took and that is not right
[Reflection of feelings] It is weird to me also how she got into another relationship fast after she broke up with you just 2 months after
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Right but to be honest i would not let that stress you out or be upset about it because you do not need anybody that don't support your career
[Providing Suggestions] I would just move on and let it go and focus on your self
[Self-disclosure] Right i can understand how you are feeling. We all have been in a situation where we have the desire to marry someone and all that fails. I have been in a situation like that.
[Providing Suggestions] I just had to let it go and just focus on myself because i had no choice
[Other] No problem. Merry christmas!
[Other] Thank you :)
[Questions] Hello, how are you today?
[Questions] I am doing well. Is anything troubling you?
[Questions] Would you like to share?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes i am here to listen.
[Reflection of feelings] It sounds like your friends can be judgmental and even though they are joking it ends up upsetting you.
[Self-disclosure] I have been in a similar situation. I always expected my friends to support and understand me but sometimes they made fun of the way i am.
[Providing Suggestions] Have you ever talked to your friends about this? Have you expressed how it made you feel?
[Information] From what i have seen if we avoid expressing our feelings they keep building up and can make us depressed.
[Reflection of feelings] I can tell that this bothers you a lot.
[Providing Suggestions] I have found that being honest and expressing our true feelings helps us and helps others understand us.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] It is not easy but you can do it. Everyone needs friends.
[Other] No problem. Enjoy the rest of your day.
[Questions] Why are you sad? Do you like to share it to me?
[Questions] That's very sad. What happened?
[Questions] I can feel you. Have you ask her why? Did you try to get her back?
[Providing Suggestions] Maybe you just give her time to think. Maybe she's also need time for her to think if she really loves you.
[Self-disclosure] If i were on your shoes, i will also feel sad. But i will also ask my self, "why did she leave me?", maybe there's something wrong with me.
[Other] Just give her time. If she really love you, she will come back and never leave you again. She just need to make her mind. Give her the space and time she needs.
[Providing Suggestions] If i were you, i'll just focus on other things and to myself as well.
[Reflection of feelings] Don't be sad. Don't overthink. Nothing will happen.
[Providing Suggestions] Try to gain her love back. Try communicating her. Treat her nice like you were only dating.
[Providing Suggestions] Maybe she just needs to feel loved again like the both of you used to
[Affirmation and Reassurance] That's the spirit
[Other] It's nothing. That's the least i can help for you.
[Questions] Do you feel better now?
[Reflection of feelings] Thank you. I'm very flattered.
[Questions] Is there anything that you would like to discuss?
[Questions] in what ways have you been beating yourself up?
[Reflection of feelings] that can be a difficult situation to be going through.
[Self-disclosure] I have gone through the same thing and have found that time passing helps, and not dwelling on the past but instead working to make things currently in your life better.
[Providing Suggestions] sometimes overthinking about things can keep your mind in a bad place, maybe there's something like a hobby or new people you can engage with?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] it can be hard, and many people share the same experience. it is not a lonely world.
[Reflection of feelings] i can feel how anxious you are about the situation.
[Questions] how long ago did you break up?
[Other] maybe with time she will be ready to talk again. sometimes people need space to collect themselves.
[Self-disclosure] i've been there! my ex ended up reaching out to me and we have slowly become friends again. it is hard to rebuild trust, and it can be a very slow process.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] you'll be alright, just take care of yourself first.
[Other] Good afternoon
[Questions] How are you doing troday?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Being in a relationship with someone when you suspect unfaithful behavior is a rough thing to go through.
[Self-disclosure] I've dealt with the same problem with my partner more than once. I love him very much and i found him to be a 9 to my 5 as well. However, the question of whether he was cheating or not was destroying my trust in him and everyone else not to mention what self-respect i had... I had to break down and talk to him about it
[Other] Ignoring this will not help things. There is no relief in pretending a question or concern does not exist.
[Self-disclosure] Like i said the question has arisen more than once. The first time he owned to talking to other women, but nothing more. Since that time, he denies everything.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Honestly, its not anyone else's business. If you're suspicions are in fact correct, then you've got to see that a loving and faithful 5 is better than a heart-breaking 10. However should you find that maybe the devils of insecurities are tricking you into thinking that she's cheating, then remember that what the two of you share o=is for the two of you. Its a relationship, not a community project! Even mu advice, albeit in the air to help you best i can. is not more important that what matters most to you and her!
[Questions] Curiously, why do you think she's cheating?
[Questions] Hmm... So have you two live together? How long has this kind of behavior persisted? When you ask her about this behavior, how do you present the question and how does she react? Finally, how often do you talk with her about the situation?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Don't get me wrong, i completely understand why you have suspicions. Really i think anyone would in the same shoes... However, as humans, we tend to either assume the best or the worst of others. There's always a margin of error present as a variable in such situations.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Forgive me if this comes off as disrespectful... I only want to help you.
[Questions] But if you feel as though you're a joke regardless, then why stay in a relationship where you're getting hurt? I know that you don't want to lose the beauty but would you not be happier with loyalty?
[Reflection of feelings] I wholly believe you should gently but steadfastly confront her. I absolutely do not mean to suggest a dispute or argument. That will not help either. Simply ask her about the things that you know aren't acceptable; lying about how long her trip was is one of them. Also, its okay to talk about how that stuff makes you feel, but try not to project your feelings as her fault. I know that it seems like they are... But she didn't make you feel any specific way, even if her actions influenced how you were already feeling.
[Other] Hi there, how are you today?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] That is really hard. I know covid has had a huge toll on folks. Do you have a good support system in place to help during this trying time?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] That's really great! Having a good support system is important right now. I understand it's difficult to find a job during these times.
[Providing Suggestions] Have you tried looking for an online only - remote position? Like some administrative work?
[Providing Suggestions] Where are you looking for jobs right now? Some of my friends have had some success by looking on linkedin or idealist.
[Providing Suggestions] How about craigslist? Not my favorite personally speaking, but might be worth taking a look.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm confident you'll find something! Hopefully you have some great self care practices in place that will help you through this time
[Self-disclosure] I do - thank you for checking :-)
[Self-disclosure] I'm an introvert / homebody so it's been fairly easy for me. I have a lot of projects at home that i enjoy doing (reading, puzzles, meditating, yoga, etc) that keep me busy. I was also, very lucky to be able to keep my full-time job so that keeps me fairly busy most days. But i like a change of scenery and do mturk tasks for fun
[Other] yes! not a whole lot honestly, but i like it.
[Other] I agree! It would be nice to have more options of things to do. I do miss going to the library and reading or a museum. Hoping more people will start to wear masks and really start to take this seriously
[Questions] How are you?
[Questions] I'm sorry, what seems to be going on?
[Other] I am very sorry to hear that.
[Questions] How long has it been cut off for?
[Providing Suggestions] Have you had a chance to talk to your employer? It often helps to get information out in the open and ensure that everyone is on the same page.
[Providing Suggestions] If you were able to talk to your boss, you may be given more clarity on whether or not your position would be one that is getting cut or not.
[Other] I understand completely, it won't be an easy conversation but i am sure you will feel better getting information on your position specifically.
[Providing Suggestions] Have you thought about reaching out to hiring agencies for help with a new job? I have gone through them before and they are very helpful!
[Reflection of feelings] I completely understand that and i can tell how uneasy this is making you.
[Self-disclosure] I had the same concerns, as i had issues with the job market when the pandemic first started but i reached out to a hiring agency and they were able to find me a job.
[Self-disclosure] I lost mine when the pandemic first started.
[Other] Not a problem!! If you ever need anything else just reach out and let us know!
[Questions] hello. how was your day?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] that's sounds good, you are learning about your job
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] don't worry my friend believe on your progress and hardwork and the luck too may be yours
[Reflection of feelings] i could understand your state right now. its hard to be in this position of fear
[Affirmation and Reassurance] yes, you are right especially during this pandemic many people face these kind of difficulties
[Providing Suggestions] Always hope for a best result. This will keep you optimistic
[Providing Suggestions]  that' sounds too good .at the same time be ready to face whatever the life gives us
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Life is full of surprises and miracles. and the same time life is full of pains and sorrow. it matters how we see even the layoff thing you can take it either as a surprise or pain
[Self-disclosure] i have also faced the same problem before two years but the luck was on my side at that time and not last for long after some months i was asked to leave but now i become normal
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] that's good. you seems to be more optimistic and acceptable in nature and your concern about your colleagues is great
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Hello how is your day going
[Questions] Im sorry to hear that please tell me about it
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand that can be flustering. Have you tried contacting your school for help?
[Reflection of feelings] It is hard to let your coworkers down but you could be honest with them and tell them what happened .
[Providing Suggestions] One thing you need to assure yourself of is that it wasnt your fault.
[Information] You do have some other methods available to you to get the transcripts.
[Questions] Have you tried contacting your state or county board of education?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] The good news is your coworkers will always look up to you even if you are not in the supervisor roll.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Your coworkers look up to you because of the person you are.
[Reflection of feelings] You can still be a big influence to your coworkers without being in the supervisor roll.
[Providing Suggestions] I think if you spent some time being a mentor to some of your coworkers you would feel better about the situation.
[Providing Suggestions] Your coworkers obviously look up to you and would appreciate your leadership in mentoring.
[Self-disclosure] Take this oppertunity to share your experience with your coworkers and reach out to your management for more training that is available to you.
[Information] Perhaps you can take some online classes on your own and show management that you are taking an interest in advancing in the company.
[Self-disclosure] Your welcome i'm glad i was able to help. Is there anything else i can help you with?
[Other] Ok goodbye.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] That is understandable, public speaking is one of the most commonly cited fears for people.
[Questions] Is it for work or for school?
[Self-disclosure] I actually majored in communication and have a great deal of experience with public speaking.
[Providing Suggestions] Yes, the physical nervousness that can manifest is powerful. I would highly recommend finding a quiet place to calm and focus your mind for at least five minutes before your presentation. At least a minute's worth of breathing, and drink plenty of water.
[Providing Suggestions] Ah, yes, that is a hard one. You are expected to be an expert. But you can only prepare so much.
[Other] "that is a really great question that i've never considered! Maybe xyz? I can check on that and get back to you with a sure answer though!"
[Providing Suggestions] There's no shame in being able to say that you understand why someone would ask the question(whatever it may be) but that you don't have a full or even partial answer right now.
[Providing Suggestions] Because you're also going to get like, the hecklers and the people who want to look intelligent by asking asinine questions
[Providing Suggestions] Just feel confident that you have fulfilled the assignment according to the guidelines. Extra questions from students are wildcards and you can only handle them within the scope of the assignment.
[Other] If someone's like well why aren't there purple pandas then, jeff?! you're gonna have to just laugh lol
[Reflection of feelings] I think you will do great. You sound prepared, and a small amount of worry is an indication you desire to perform well.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm so glad to hear that! You have an excellent attitude and work ethic, you got this!
[Other] You too!
[Questions] I know sometimes it can be difficult to make decisions. What dilemma are you facing today?
[Self-disclosure] I too, have been in your place. There were days i would just stare blankly without being productive. However, i tried meditating which helped me improve my focus.
[Providing Suggestions] I am glad you asked. At first, it can seem a little difficult. But the key is to start small and build as you go. For example, allocating 10 minutes after lunch or borrowing some time off of social media.
[Information] From what i know, you can try to relax before making any decision. I usually follow my intuition and decide. I deal with the outcome later. But meditating has really helped me avoid anxiety.
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds as if you are low on self-confidence and are afraid about unfavourable outcomes. Please correct me if i am wrong.
[Reflection of feelings] I can feel your anxiety just through this chat conversation.
[Providing Suggestions] In my experience, even if we were to fail, we are bestowed with a valuable life lesson which we can use in future decisions. Approaching the problem with positive mindset will help a lot! Is that something you'd be willing to try?
[Information] That's true. However, research shows that any habit can be broken or formed if you put your mind to it everyday for 5-10 minutes for 3 continuous weeks. Perhaps, replacing your negative thoughts with happy ones might help.
[Other] Awesome. I am glad i was able to get you started towards a positive mentality. Is there anything else that i can assist you with today?
[Other] You're welcome! Have a wonderful week ahead!
[Reflection of feelings] That stinks. I understand how that can hurt.
[Questions] How long had you been together?
[Questions] And how did she break your heart?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] So it sounds like she broke up with you over email rather than face to face or even a call. Not very considerate.
[Reflection of feelings] From talking with you i can tell this has been a real blow and need to find a way to move on.
[Self-disclosure] I've had that happen before to me a few times. It's just the absolute worst feeling.
[Information] One of your first thoughts might be to get back out there, but really the best thing to do is to start doing things that you like, and that improve you personally.
[Providing Suggestions] Do you enjoy any hobbies, or going to the gym? If so, that might be a great place to start.
[Other] That's perfect, and a great way to get your mind off her while having fun at the same time.
[Providing Suggestions] Glad to hear it. Also, once you feel you're ready, there are plenty of ways to meet new girls. There's the obvious places like online dating or bars, but also some not so obvious like the farmers market or shopping
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I hope it works out for you in the end. I'm sure it will!
[Reflection of feelings] I can tell by our chat that you're feeling better already!
[Other] Yep, still here. Are you still seeing my messages?
[Questions] Hello, how can i help you today?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] So if i understand correctly, you are upset with your job and your manager?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry to hear that. I can imagine it is challenging to work at a place where you are unhappy. And i understand it is a tough time right now.
[Self-disclosure] Yes, i can totally relate! I have been there. I was in a very similar situation at a previous job when departments were reorganized and i ended up working for someone who wasn't familiar with my work. It was a challenge and frustrating.
[Providing Suggestions] While i know jobs are scarce right now, do you think you might consider at least taking a look at some job sites, doing some searches just to see if there are some other jobs you might be interested in?
[Reflection of feelings] Oh yes, i totally get that! I remember having to do the exact same thing, very frustrating!
[Information] That is a great idea! And there are job sites such as indeed and others you can search to see what jobs are available. You never know. I just know how challenging it is to be in a situation where you are unhappy with your job.
[Other] Journaling is an excellent idea!! It has helped me a lot! It can help you discover things you might not have otherwise thought about.
[Other] That sounds great! Yes, updating your resume is important.
[Other] I totally get understand that! I know you are in a challenging situation now. But you have come up with some great ideas and you sound very intelligent! I believe in you and feel things will get better for you!
[Other] Absolutely! That is great! Thank you so much! I hope you have a great day as well! And good luck to you! :)
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ouch! I'm so sorry to hear that. I never lost a dog, but i've lost cats.
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Is 14 a good age for a dog?
[Self-disclosure] I have my first dog so i don't know much, he is 9 years old and came with our house.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm so sorry, losing a pet is very hard on us.
[Questions] Was that your only pet? Or do you have others? We moved from fl to ky and the little dog just hung out here, he really belonged to the neighbor's son who didn't want him, so he just ran around wild and wouldn't leave. I never had a dog, but it got cold, so i took him in. They never asked about him and after a week, i asked them if i could have the dog, so they said yes. I don't think they cared.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I wish i could give you a hug, really, there are no words to make this better as you already know the grief of losing a pet, it does get better, but it stings terribly at first.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] So you definitely are a dog lover! I was in my 50s before i ever had a dog, now i wish i had more, they are really loving. Not like cats who don't care much about much except food! lol
[Self-disclosure] I know when tragedy happens, i can't get stuck in depression, i sort of have to force myself to put one foot in front of the other. It's hard to have a healthy balance between grieving and continuing to live. Cry, then dry my eyes, pick up, go for a walk, don't get caught in grief, but yet don't deny it!
[Self-disclosure] I get stuck too. But you are doing the right things, here you reached out to someone and i do care, so you are moving forward.
[Other] I always find it helpful just so have someone share my pain with me. Just to know i'm not alone.
[Self-disclosure] I do understand. My mom died in 2010, right after she died, 1 of my cats died, my husband went into the hospital and almost died, so we went on vacation so i would not be consumed with grief, and do you know, we brought our pets and our cat died when we arrived here on vacation? I will never forget that. You know what. I knew i could either get consumed in grief, or push through. Man, that was hard. I prayed a lot and god got me through that and i had a good vacation, all things considered.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I will definitely pray for you too that god will comfort your heart and that you will be comforted by your other dogs and your boyfriend's dogs and that you will feel joy at times at the happy memories you had with your dog.
[Self-disclosure] Prayer is what gets me through every day! :d it was rough, but i believe these hard times strengthen us in some way. Because life throws hard balls, and we have to move forward or be consumed.
[Reflection of feelings] I'm so glad i did too. It was a pleasure to meet you. And once again, (hug). :d
[Self-disclosure] I have one more thing to say - wise words from this 92 year old lady at church named sue. She told me this after my brother died. When you get older, everyone you know is practically dead. She said "life is for the living, if you get caught up to much in all the death, you won't life." true words. God bless, have a good night.
[Providing Suggestions] Hi. How can i help?
[Information] What has happened? I know that sometimes life can get tough and just know that you are not alone. Sometimes the toughest parts of life, make us so much stronger.
[Providing Suggestions] Why do you think it's your body? I am sure that your body is just fine! Have you thought about taking up a hobby or activity to get your mind off of it?
[Providing Suggestions] I understand. What kinds of things do you enjoy? I have found that exercise is great for mental health and such a good way to take your mind off of things. Have you ever felt interested in any psychical activities?
[Self-disclosure] Do you have any friends or family to help you? I know exactly what you mean. Starting a new activity can be so hard when you aren't familiar. One thing that you might find helpful is to join in a group class at the gym. Do you think you'd like that?
[Other] That's great! Do you know what kind of class would be of interest? I think that you have the tools to be who you want to be. It sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders and i think you'll be just fine! You may even find a life long passion or friendship! You never know what is around the corner.
[Providing Suggestions] Those both sounds great! Yoga is great for the body and the mind! I will sometimes just do it to clear my mind after a tough day. If your nervous about it, you could try out a few online classes first to see what to expect.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] That's understandable. Everyone has insecurities in unfamiliar places but in reality, most people are too wrapped up in their own heads they don't even notice anything else. You just have to feel confident and not worry about what other people think, that will set you free.
[Providing Suggestions] Have you tried the classified ads? Or check on facebook for a jobs page in your area?
[Providing Suggestions] I would suggest starting with one of those options.
[Questions] do you have a resume?
[Providing Suggestions] I would suggest you type one up, most employers want an application and a resume.
[Providing Suggestions] Perhaps a friend can help you, if not they have programs on the web to help assist with that.
[Questions] Have you been out of work for a while?
[Other] your welcome.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Are you saying you have been out of work for a while?
[Questions] Okay, are you saying your working from home?
[Providing Suggestions] Then perhaps you should look for part time work.
[Questions] I am a little confused. Are you looking for employment or not?
[Other] Okay, in the mean time follow my advice. It will help.
[Questions] any other questions?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Depression is extremely rough to deal with, i'm very sorry to hear you're going through that.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh yes, less light during the day makes the days seem compacted and suffocating
[Self-disclosure] I believe there are special lamps that you could get to help. I personally have been trying to get up a little earlier in the morning and enjoy my coffee with the sunrise and a scroll through instagram
[Self-disclosure] I also already have to schedule and routinize my day because i work and go to school from home, so i make sure to give myself breaks where i literally must get up and leave my desk, be in another room for a little while.
[Providing Suggestions] Sure, that's understandable. There are opportunities throughout the day to get a little more vitamin d, you just have to make sure to give yourself time to enjoy them.
[Other] Now that is intractable
[Self-disclosure] Sometimes, to me, the enormity of the universe is calming to my anxiety. Being assured that i mean absolutely nothing is nice sometimes.
[Other] Not in a scary, better-off-dead kind of way, but in the way that a galaxy is a slow moving explosion. I'm a flea to the universe.
[Other] ... then you have to wonder, what are fleas thinking?!
[Other] God, tell me more, lol
[Other] Galaxies gonna spiral.
[Reflection of feelings] Yeah they have kicked the can down to local governments, local governments kick the can down to the citizens. It's absurd. No on wants to take responsibility for taking responsibility.
[Providing Suggestions] It's a very uncertain situation and it's a psychological reality that when we don't have physical or metnal security, it's extremely hard for a human being to progress through stages in life or learn new skill as well or at all
[Reflection of feelings] So everyone's plans are canceled for the year, plus no one has any idea when the shit's going to end, so not unlike a dog at the vet, the suffering seems interminable.
[Other] Of course, have a great evening!
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] I hear you are trying to be perfect on your job because you are worried about losing your job. How long have you been at your job?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] That can be hard when you are working so hard to try to do your best. Can you consult with a supervisor or co-workers to get some help?
[Self-disclosure] Asking for help isn't always a bad thing. I asked for help at my last job and they gave me someone to help out. I was so relieved.
[Reflection of feelings] I can see that you have worry of being seen incompetent but as long as you are doing your best, they have to see the efforts you are making as positive.
[Providing Suggestions] Sometimes deep breaths can help keep you calm when approaching others in an anxiety provoking situation.
[Information] Have you thought of doing additional work related trainings? Sometimes they can give suggestions to improve work abilities.
[Information] Work can often pay for trainings or offer suggestions what may improve work strategies.
[Information] You could ask your immediate supervisor or sometimes human resources for support.
[Questions] That sounds like a good plan to reach out for support. Is there anything else i can help with?
[Other] You are very welcome.
[Questions] How are you?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sorry to hear that. It's rough to get stressed
[Questions] Would you like to tell me what's going on?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh no! I can totally understand why you're stressing over that! Absolutely valid reason for anxiety.
[Questions] May i ask how much of the whole grade was the test's percentage?
[Questions] What was you're score?
[Other] That isn't technically a failed grade by the standards of most professors. Albeit a low grade, it's a d. Anything below 59% would qualify as failed.
[Questions] Have you done fairly well in other classes? How have your grades been prior to this test in that class?
[Other] I hate that you feel that way about yourself, but i can also relate to having a rough time learning via online classes. I'm the same way. However, that does not disable you from being able to learn. It impedes your quality of learning, no doubt. But it isn't something that you can help.
[Reflection of feelings] By having an attitude of being unable to learn, you automatically lower your expectations for the success you would potentially have otherwise...
[Reflection of feelings] Omgoodness no kidding. This whole pandemic has the world in a tizzy!
[Affirmation and Reassurance] If i were you i would not wait! It may not be the best option for your learning style, and it will certainly prove a greater challenge. However, taking on that challenge will bring on sweeter rewards when you succeed! Adopt a "can-do" state of mind and grab the bull by the horns!
[Other] You're so very welcome!
[Questions] Tell me about the situation that you are facing
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] I am sorry to hear that. How long have you been looking?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand that there are a lot of job loss in the covid time. Is your job seeking related to that?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Yeah it must be very difficult.
[Reflection of feelings] I was applying for jobs for almost a year, and i got an offer in february right before coronavirus. I can definitely relate to you.
[Self-disclosure] I am glad that mechanical turk can provide an intermediate method of earning income. I am also using the platform to earn some extra cash to support family.
[Other] Tell me more about it if you don't mind. What kind of academic and professional background do you have, and what kind of positions are you seeking?
[Other] I see. Would you ideally want to work for a manufacturer company instead of settling down for something temporary while seeking a more matched position?
[Information] I understand. Do you have location requirements, for instance, you would prefer working remotely instead of in person in the covid time?
[Providing Suggestions] I have been browsing job boards every now and then. There are consistently some grocery store jobs, or cashier jobs. If you don't mind the location, i am sure you would be a good fit for these.
[Providing Suggestions] I completely understand. I was looking for jobs for almost a year. I have a spreadsheet that keeps track of all the jobs i applied. Maybe only 2 or 3 percent of them replied (with an interview request, etc.) I would suggest trying applying for jobs via linkedin, or google jobs. You can sort them by posted date. My experience is that the more recent the posting date is, the more likely they will review your application.
[Other] Previously i also registered in a few temp agencies that would place me in companies with the intension of only keeping in on board for a few months/weeks. They can be a good gap filler as well.
[Reflection of feelings] I hope i can be more helpful. I really sympathize with your situation.
[Other] They would just terminate me after they have found a permanent employee on an ongoing basis. In rare situations, they would hire "temp-to-hire" with the expectation of hiring temp workers.
[Other] Thank you for reaching out. It really shows that you care and you are working towards the goal. I hope you succeed.
[Self-disclosure] Happy holidays and best wishes to you.
[Questions] When did this fear start?
[Reflection of feelings] It sounds like your childhood trauma and the economy is the cause for you not being confident in your job situation. Is this correct?
[Other] Do you have anyone you can talk to about this? A relative or a close peer at your job?
[Self-disclosure] You know, i once felt the same you are feeling and had the same idea that everyone had their own problems, but i took the courage to seek for help and found out that the people who really care about me will always want to help me.
[Providing Suggestions] There are many counselors who specialize in this field of job security and especially during this pandemic and the falling economy, they are great support systems.
[Providing Suggestions] If you want other suggestions, meditation is something that is extremely overlooked and will help you before you even take the big leap to get support from a counselor or relative. Just taking deep breaths in a quiet area is a great way to clear your head and keep optimistic.
[Information] Since a lot of this stress is being caused by your childhood trauma, it seems like there is something that connects that job to your trauma and if it cant be disconnected, it seems like you should find another job.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] And i understand that is not the easiest in these times but i believe you can do it!
[Questions] Do you think those jobs would help you disconnect your childhood trauma and work life?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Just giving it a try is what starts every journey and i am proud of you for taking that leap!
[Other] No problem i hope all goes well for you and i hope you stay safe.
[Other] Goodbye!
[Other] I am sorry to hear that
[Self-disclosure] I am ok thank you for asking
[Questions] will your bad grade affect your overall grade very bad?
[Providing Suggestions] oh no, do you think you could do something to earn some extra credit?
[Self-disclosure] I was the opposite in school i could pass a test no problem but i was not good on writing papers
[Questions] Is your overall grade pretty high without the grade from this current paper?
[Providing Suggestions] Maybe you could talk to your teacher and find out what they feel you could have done differently to get a better grade.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] since it is only your first grade of the semester try not to let it get you to down, i am sure you can pull you average back up
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i would not take that to personally. i am sure he was just saying that to make everyone second guess themselves and push themselves to work harder
[Other] Oh no thanks need you seem to be very smart i am sure you are going to do well
[Self-disclosure] well thank you its always nice to feel apperciated!
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I wish you all the best of luck with your schooling this semester!
[Other] Happy holidays to you to!
[Questions] Hey what's going on?
[Questions] what are you mad about?
[Questions] what's going on at work that's so frustrating?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] wow, that's super frustrating! I would be pretty upset too
[Questions] How did you find out?
[Questions] wow... did anyone else hear?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I would be furious too. It puts you in a very strange spot. If you say something, you look bad, and if you don't you feel bad.
[Providing Suggestions] I absolutely understand. You know. the end of the year is coming up and it's probably not the best time to leave a job without having anything lined up.
[Providing Suggestions] that's good! I think budgets are going to be tight in many industries and you need to make sure you are okay financially and have insurance and unfortuantely both of those are tied to employers.
[Providing Suggestions] That's a good point. I suggest continuing to look and see what you can find. There will be people hiring.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I think that's a good call, you should definitely get out of there though, but make sure you have good enough coverage.
[Other] i am good how can i help you today?
[Other] i am so sorry you are feeling depressed i can understand how you are feeling.
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] i can understand in this time it is hard finding a job during this pandemic
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Yes wearing a mask can be hard but it is for everyone protection and you are doing the right thing
[Providing Suggestions] have you tried looking online for jobs?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] don't let this get the best of you just know everything will be ok and you will find a job
[Reflection of feelings] we are all going through a tough time right now with the coronavirus going around and it will make everyone get depressed but don't let it get to you
[Providing Suggestions] you should go to places and talk to the hiring manager and see if they are hiring
[Reflection of feelings] yes i can understand they are never there when you go try to talk to them
[Providing Suggestions] but all you can do is try right now
[Affirmation and Reassurance] things will get better soon for you and you will get a call from a job
[Affirmation and Reassurance] sometimes all we need is some support
[Other] just keep searching online and going to different places and putting in job applications i am really sure you will get a job soon
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you have some worries about life? Would you like to share them?
[Questions] Do you feel that perhaps you are playing video games as a distraction from how bad the world is at the moment?
[Self-disclosure] Ah, so it's a long term hobby? I do love gaming myself i have to admit.
[Providing Suggestions] Could you perhaps set yourself some strict boundaries, like you can only do a certain number of hours of gaming a day?
[Information] It sounds like you might have a genuine addiction to gaming. Do you think you might benefit from some counselling? There are organisations that can help.
[Other] Well, if it is affecting your grades and the rest of your real life then it might be. And it's best to catch these things before they get worse.
[Questions] Have you been getting into trouble with your teachers about this or has no-one noticed so far?
[Questions] Does your school have a counsellor?
[Questions] Do you feel that they have not been of any help?
[Other] There are always external counsellors that you could speak to. How would you feel if, for instance, you were never allowed to game again? Would that significantly affect your quality of life?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I do understand that it can be very difficult to open up about having a problem
[Other] The trouble is that sometimes the person with a problem can be the last to actually realise it
[Other] I hope that i've been able to give you something to think about :) It's been nice to talk!
[Other] You're welcome - enjoy the rest of your day!
[Other] Remember to press the button at the bottom :)
[Other] Hello, are you still with me?
[Other] That sounds like a stressful situation.
[Self-disclosure] I have also struggled with staying focused while working from home.
[Providing Suggestions] Have you tried making a designated study area?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you are trying very hard to change your situation during this crazy year.
[Providing Suggestions] Is there a way to connect with other students taking the same classes?
[Providing Suggestions] If not maybe you could initiate a zoom study/discussion group.
[Other] I wish you much luck in your continuing education. I know that you can find a way to connect with other students and succeed!
[Other] Thank you, i hope you do too!
[Questions] How are you?
[Other] What did you do today?
[Questions] I've heard about how difficult online school is for a lot of people this year. I can imagine how stressful it must be with this new learning curve.
[Questions] Is it the online classes causing the challenges? Or are there other stressors in your life as well?
[Self-disclosure] That does sound very difficult. Online classes were hard for me when i did them as well.
[Providing Suggestions] I have heard that. How often do you communicate with your professor and classmates? Keeping a clear line of communication is the best way to face these kind of challenges in my experience.
[Reflection of feelings] I am sorry to hear that you are having doubts about achieving your goals.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Sometimes, there are anxieties that persist despite our best efforts.
[Providing Suggestions] Do you have any methods that you currently use to help relax when you feel anxious and fearful about the future? Maybe i can help.
[Providing Suggestions] Distraction can sometimes be necessary, but might also be harmful if it's used too much. I suggest writing down some of your feelings to help process the doubts and find ways to be hopeful about the future.
[Other] You are welcome. Is there anything else that you would like to talk about?
[Other] I hope you have a good week and find peace in your studies!
[Questions] I'm sorry to hear that. Is there any change in your routine as of lately?
[Reflection of feelings] These past few months has been extremely difficult. In the past, what did you do for your depression?
[Providing Suggestions] Talking to a professional is always ideal. Is there a way to see that psychiatrist again?
[Providing Suggestions] It wouldn't hurt to try and reach out. If she isn't available, there are other services.
[Information] Not necessarily support groups, but more like psychiatry apps where a trained professional is available via chat, or video and its specifically through the app.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] There a lot more since covid began in march, so it's worth as a backup plan if your doctor isn't available. Sometimes its good to have options.
[Self-disclosure] After my son was born i developed post partem depression and anxiety. It wasn't until almost a year and half after he was born to realize it.
[Self-disclosure] It was. Luckily i had my doctor to help me. Family members meant well but chalked it up to "that's what its like to be a mom" but it is more than that.
[Providing Suggestions] I agree. There is a lot of well meaning advice out there, but its best to see a professional to really help you.
[Other] I'm glad i could help. I hope you get to speak with your psychiatrist, or at least find a good one through an app.
[Questions] Okay, how can i help you?
[Reflection of feelings] Is there anything particular that has got you feeling down lately?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Its always good to have someone to talk to, i am happy to help. I have felt stuck many times, so i can understand that.
[Questions] Well i had to sit down and think about why i was stuck and tried to come up with as many options as i could to be unstuck, then i put them in order based on which i thought would work best. It took quite a few of them, but i did finally get unstuck.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Every one is different, but it is worth a shot, might help the rut your having, might also give you new ideas that will help you decide on how to not feel like your in a rut anymore. Sometimes just talking to someone can help too, bouncing ideas off of each other can help in some cases.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Its hard to talk about certain problems, so i can't blame you, however you can get some good ideas from others. You might have just needed some space to evaluate your situation, nothing wrong with taking a break from things or people if it helps you.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] From chatting with you i can tell you might be ready to start talking and maybe get some help or advice, family is a great start they are typically a great support system. It is okay to feel embarrassed but being unhappy will eat at you, sometimes its good to set our pride aside so that we can figure things out. In my situation of feeling stuck i was ashamed that i sat and let people treat me so badly but it wasn't until i seen it as a problem that i started making my lists and getting advice. Some things we do on our own and some its good to have people to help. I think reaching out to your sister would be worth a try, she might also have different ideas and suggestions you haven' t thought of yet.
[Other] Thank you for chatting with me, i am glad to help. I hope you have a great day! Stay positive!
[Providing Suggestions] If you need to chat again i would be glad to talk to you, i think you will do great at fixing your rut. Thank you.
[Other] Bye.
[Questions] Hello there, how is your day going?
[Questions] Is there something that you'd like to talk about?
[Questions] Wow that sounds like a big problem. Is he aware of how much distress this is causing you?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you feel that he is misunderstanding life? That he feels that he deserves things just for existing?
[Self-disclosure] It sounds like a really toxic relationship - i hear you! I have been in that position also. In the end i felt that i had no choice but to leave. I cannot tell you what to do, though.
[Information] Ah, unfortunately a lot of men are like that - before you become seriously committed they seem totally different. Have you considered seeking professional help?
[Providing Suggestions] I believe that there are some organisations that will offer free therapy sessions for people in need. Have you considered asking your doctor?
[Other] I am not totally sure what is available but i think that there might be such things
[Other] Well no, i don't think that all men are like this by any stretch of the imagination. Unfortunately, however, there are some bad apples who give all men a bad name. I am sure that the same applies to women too though!
[Affirmation and Reassurance] You sound to me as though you are being realistic and sensible about your financial situation and are being neither too stingy nor too lavish.
[Other] I hope that i have been able to be of some help to you!
[Other] Have a lovely rest of day
[Questions] I'm sorry to hear that . How can i help?
[Other] I understand. Tell me what's going on.
[Self-disclosure] I'm here to listen.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand. It is a scary time right now. Things will not always be this way though. We will get through it.
[Providing Suggestions] The important part right now is to stay safe and healthy for yourself and for your family.
[Questions] What kind of work did you do before the pandemic?
[Providing Suggestions] Yes our country is in a lot of uncertainty right now. And having a second income always helps. Have you considered possibly finding a work from home job? Perhaps look at what skills you've developed, and update your resume to reflect the skills you have that will transfer over to a work from home job.
[Providing Suggestions] I understand. There are always companies or jobs out there that are scams. What i found worked best was looking at reputable sites like linkedin, glassdoor, etc. Right now is a good time to find a work from home job from reputable companies. I've found that a lot of companies have transitioned over and developed jobs that can be done from home. I actually work from home myself.
[Providing Suggestions] Another suggestion i can make is contacting your local workforce department (department of unemployment) as they can make suggestions too.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] You already have a lot of skills you didn't think about. As a stay at home parent, you are like the ceo of your own company. You manage day to day operations. You also do scheduling, finance management, etc.
[Information] I understand feeling guilty for asking for help. But don't worry that is what they are there for!
[Information] would you like to tell me more about it?
[Questions] Why do you feel you can't turn to your friend?
[Providing Suggestions] I am sorry to hear that sounds like she sure could use some help as well. Have you tried first taking about her issues and then telling her about yours?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] I am sorry to her that, so it sounds like you feel you need to give her help but you dont get any from her. But is also sounds like she might not be aware of you needing help.
[Other] I think you need to try to tell her about your problems, and maybe even if she feels like she is helping you she is more inclined to help herself some too?
[Other] I know, it would be nice of her to ask how are you? But maybe she thinks you are a very strong person that does not need help since you do not voice it.?
[Information] Yes the feeling that you help someone can be uplifting and good for anyones ego
[Providing Suggestions] I would try to find a conversation and then tell her like sometimes i could use help with whatever and then tell her that you feel lonely and need her sometimes as well
[Other] Give it a try and you are not alone as you see we had a nice conversation.
[Other] Hi, my day is goin well.
[Questions] I am sorry to hear that, what is going on?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] To be sure i understand correctly, you are worried you are going to lose your job because of covid-19.
[Self-disclosure] I completely understand this feeling as when the pandemic began i was also extremely worried about my job security as well.
[Reflection of feelings] I can definitely tell through chatting with you that you are extremely anxious about the situation.
[Questions] What industry do you work in?
[Providing Suggestions] Have you talked to your manager about the situation?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand your anxiety due to this, but i know you can make it through this situation!
[Providing Suggestions] Have you talked to friends or family members about this? I found that when i was going through my anxiety, talking to my family was very useful.
[Self-disclosure] I have been on anxiety medicine before and it definitely helped me as well.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] You can definitely get through this!
[Questions] Hi! How can i help you today ?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] It looks like you are missing your friends a a lot. am i right?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I am missing my friends and family too. Due to covid it's hard for all of us to meet our near and dear. I can totally understand your feeling.
[Self-disclosure] I do video call. It makes me feel that they are very close to me.
[Reflection of feelings] I can feel how much you are missing them especially in holidays. engaging yourself in doing the stuff which you love can be a good idea
[Information] Sadness can lead us to frustration. To avoid that we have to stay motivated and keep doing something which takes those negative thoughts away
[Other] you can play online games with your friends
[Providing Suggestions] giving task or challenges to each other, making funny videos, having competition for cleaning room are few example which can be tried.
[Other] giving task is my favorite :)
[Providing Suggestions] Telling friend to drink 4 glass of water at once, making bed in 30 seconds, finding particular content on laptop in specific time(30 sec or45 sec)
[Other] No problem! Is there anything else that i can help you with
[Other] Thanks! Have a wonderful time !
[Other] Hello, merry christmas eve
[Questions] How are you today? I am buried in cookie dough, lol, but happy and wwell.
[Questions] Yes it is nice. Are you doing anything festive today?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand that times are rough lately. Sounds like there is some time to figure it out, take full advantage of all the time you can. I hope it works out and a new position becomes available, i know your story is shared by many right now. What a crazy time we are in
[Other] yes it does, on top it says inputing
[Other] what are cv's? I see, i am getting by by dping a billion a day lol
[Questions] but there is other income, im not sure it would support me otherwise. Are there other lines of work you could look into?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] well the title sounds legit, lol, but yes i see and understand. Did you do the trainging in the warehouse for the research job?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] oh i see.
[Self-disclosure] If this odd job tasks site exists maybe there a more related oppurtunites to get into that pay more. Or really, the green field is a good one to get into right now i think like solar companies and such. They are going to become more prevalent soon.
[Self-disclosure] I make a good case right so you might think i was but no, i am not i only wish to be. I wish to be much more than i am but ya know i work with what i can find to do. Id savd the world every day if zi could knowing my efforts were toowrads a good cause.
[Providing Suggestions] I always tell my other half, they might just take a chance and hire out of their skill zone if you have drive and interest in the field.
[Other] as we were told growing up the worst they could say is no,
[Other] yes for sure dont go on like that for too long.
[Providing Suggestions] any who my computer is going to die i want to finish befoe it does, it that ok?
[Other] ok nice chat you too
[Other] good luck
[Other] You are very welcome!
[Questions] Is there anything i can help you with today?
[Other] I will be happy to help! Lets go over what's going on to see how we can work together to solve it.
[Reflection of feelings] I understand. Job instability can be stressful in itself, and adding debt on top of that can make it worse.
[Questions] Why do you have a fear of losing your job?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand. You are afraid of losing your job due to the company possibly shutting down.
[Self-disclosure] I've gone through that myself. I understand how scary it is,especially since it is out of your hands.
[Providing Suggestions] What i found that helped was preparing myself for the shutdown. I updated my resume, and started looking at other options for work in case the company did shut down. I also took documentation such as email, or any written correspondence confirming that the shut down may occur, in case i had to file for unemployment.
[Questions] I understand this is a scary time for you. Is there anything you like to do to relieve stress?
[Reflection of feelings] I understand how frustrating it can be, especially with covid turning our world upside down!
[Questions] May i please know what field you are in?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] First fall, i tip my hat to you! It is because of people like you, our frontline heroes, that we are at least able to put some fight up against the corona demon!
[Information] I hope you heard that major pharma companies have tested vaccines which are 90-95 % effective! Given the current advancement in technology, it is a great news.
[Reflection of feelings] I understand. Part time or reduced hours can be a source of concern.
[Information] We just need to trust them to bring the vaccine to the public. I hope in due time they will publish their detailed research and development papers.
[Questions] Regarding your situation, have you tried a secondary source of income? Like becoming a delivery driver or an order taker?
[Information] Ok. I suppose you can try online jobs. One of my friends lives outside the city and is a part time online order taker for pizza hut.
[Information] All you need is phone and internet. You will need to take customer's orders and input it in pizza hut's order system.
[Questions] is this something you can explore doing?
[Information] Great! You can search for "pizza hut online order taking job". The first result will lead you to the company that manages these jobs.
[Information] Once you complete training, the pay is good especially during weekends, where peak load hits.
[Other] I am glad i could be of help. I wish you all the best!
[Other] Hello.
[Questions] How are you tonight?
[Questions] How can i help you?
[Questions] What is causing this fear?
[Reflection of feelings] Just from these few messages, i can tell you are very anxious about this situation.
[Providing Suggestions] Have you spoken with your supervisor about how you feel? Often times it helps to make sure your supervisor is aware of your concerns.
[Self-disclosure] I can definitely understand this feeling, as i was also very worried at the beginning of the pandemic about my job security.
[Providing Suggestions] Another thing that really helped me was to take more time in the various hobbies i enjoy outside of work.
[Other] I found it very useful!
[Other] No problem! I am glad i was able to chat with you today!
[Other] You are very welcome! Feel free to chat anytime you need anything!
[Questions] What would you like to know?
[Self-disclosure] I like to play a lot of video games with friends to help me relax and take my mind off things,
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] I am glad i have been able to make you more relaxed.
[Self-disclosure] I am in new york state
[Information] Niagara falls is pretty famous here.
[Questions] I am doing well. Whats bothering you?
[Reflection of feelings] Oh no! I am so sorry that has happened to you. That must feel like such a betrayal.
[Questions] Can you tell me more about it?
[Providing Suggestions] Dating can definitely complicate things.. Oh my gosh..... that is horrible. Surely there is something you can do to try to get your money back.
[Questions] Did you sign anything? or have proof of what happened?
[Providing Suggestions] What was the business? It depends on your location but i'm sure just on the transaction alone that shows some kind of intent. or text messages saying it was for a specific purpose?
[Information] If you gave her a large amount of money and have any kind of messages about it i would look into trying to get it back.
[Providing Suggestions] I would seek the advice of a lawyer. I'm sorry this has happened thats horrible.
[Providing Suggestions] I would say 80k is worth speaking to a lawyer about it. I'm sorry you are so conflicted. I would not call the police because you willingly gave it to her. I would hire a lawyer to handle it.
[Providing Suggestions] I would not talk to a mutual friend about this at all....
[Questions] I understand... What kind of work do you do?
[Questions] I understand that. How else are you
[Questions] I am jason by the way... How am i speaking with?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Well i am male although i understand having issues everyday.
[Questions] Are things slow at your work?
[Questions] How are you feeling right now?
[Reflection of feelings] Well what's going on with your work? What's causing so much pressure in your life?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand that, kind of makes you feel mistrustful?
[Self-disclosure] I love music
[Questions] I honestly listen to mostly rap... lol what about you? What do you like?
[Reflection of feelings] Although i pretty much listen to anything. Second in line is country lol
[Questions] What is your favorite instrument?
[Questions] I love piano, my favorite anyway... Do you play?
[Reflection of feelings] I understand that. I tried to play once, but it was difficult. Variety is the spice of life.
[Self-disclosure] I got further with piano than guitar, but that still wasn't far. I tick with just listening now.
[Self-disclosure] I do enjoy it. I listen to music while i do everything. I run every morning as well so music is great. The running helps to relieve stress.
[Questions] What other hobbies do you have?
[Questions] I understand that. They definitely bring joy into our lives. Do you just have one?
[Self-disclosure] Well i am married with a wife and daughter... Been together for 15 years almost.
[Questions] I am actually at the office today. I couldn't the day off.
[Questions] Do you celebrate christmas?
[Other] Merry christmas!
[Other] I just needed to tell you that in case you haven't heard it from anyone today.
[Other] Yes of course
[Questions] What is on your mind?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ok great have a great day
[Questions] What work is that?
[Other] Have an amazing christmas!
[Questions] Hello! How may i assist you today?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds you did not sleep. am i right?
[Other] Oh! sorry to hear about that. I can understand it might be tough for you to deal all this
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I know you can handle this tough time situation. These tough time teach us so many lessons and give the solutions too.
[Reflection of feelings] By chatting with you i can totally understand how you are feeling at this movement. Such situations put so much burden on us
[Self-disclosure] I feel the same when there is some financial or emotional problems in my life. Then i realize why i am not that strong to face it or why i was not prepare for it?
[Other] From my past experience i have leant at tough time like this, we should not give up. We should keep trying and some solution will come definitely.
[Information] What i have seen if we keep trying and stay motivated towards our goal, we for sure get that
[Providing Suggestions] Sure! I would suggest you to keep trying, try to stay positive in this tough time where we all are struggling
[Other] Wishing you best wishes and stay healthy
[Other] you too! bye
[Questions] Taking finals certainly is tough, there's so much to think about. What's bothering you the most?
[Questions] Have you spoken to anyone at the college about this?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] It must make you feel quite trapped knowing that the college aren't cutting you a bit of slack considering you are still recovering from a serious illness. It sounds like you are trying your best and not giving up already.
[Self-disclosure] It's good to hear that you're not giving up. Sometimes in these situations, you just have to do your best and then at least you know you did what you could. I like to tell myself in these situations that if there are no other avenues to explore, you just have to 'go with the flow' and don't beat yourself up thinking about it over and over - if there's nothing you can do, just do your best to ride it out
[Self-disclosure] If you tried hard previously then you may come out the other end having done very well! When i was at school a long time ago, i had to stay off school for a month, when they were practising the exams. I didn't get chance to do those and i thought 'wow i'm totally screwed here', but guess what? I did okay!
[Other] Yes, i'm here
[Affirmation and Reassurance] It's totally understandable. I think even without the covid situation, you would still be anxious. It's totally natural. Not that that discounts how you feel. Do you agree?
[Providing Suggestions] Well, i've tried meditating a few times before which doesn;t take it all away, it just takes the edge off! I used a guided meditation app. I also listened to white noise when i went to sleep as i was having trouble sleeping. I find even if you're mind is just taken away from it all for a few minute, it can re-balance you a little
[Providing Suggestions] Maybe you should do more of that, it sounds like a good idea? Don't feel guilty for doing so either as it acts as a 'medicine'. If the 'medicine' works then take it
[Other] Sounds like a plan! It's certainly worth giving it a go. We need a break from it all sometimes or we'd all go mad.
[Questions] How are you feeling? Is there anything the matter?
[Self-disclosure] Oh my i'm so sorry that happened to you. I can't completely relate, but my parents are going through something very similar after 25 years of marriage. Tell me more about it.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I am so sorry. Does your child know? I have a 10 year old and she is struggling with my parents, we lived with them for the first 2 years of her life and have always been 15 minutes away since. I completely understand why you feel the way you do that is to be expected. You are not stupid and i'm sure its not you. Have you spoken to your fiance about this since you found out?
[Information] I'm so sorry. From personal experience, my best advice is to be as direct as possible. Demand respect and answers that you deserve after 13 years.
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] If he will not answer your questions, thats all the answers you need. How did you find out?
[Reflection of feelings] I can't even imagine how you feel. Clarity and answers are so important right now for you... no matter if it is true or not. That is a long time to be with someone.
[Questions] Oh my gosh. There's all the answers you need right there. I'm so sorry. He wont even speak to you about it? No excuses anything? Have you told family?
[Reflection of feelings] You must express this in some way to let this out. It's not healthy to let your anger bottle up. I'm sure you're angry, rightfully so... do you have any hobbies to occupy your mind until you get things sorted?
[Other] That's awesome. Working out can release so much stress. I hope things work out so you can get some sort of closure.
[Providing Suggestions] You're welcome. I wish you the best of luck. Try to stay positive. It sounds like you are handling this the best you can.
[Other] I am doing well. I've been handling the pandemic surprisingly well given i deal with germaphobia myself. I can't wait for this all to be over.
[Questions] Is there something i can help you with today?
[Self-disclosure] Yeah, socially distancing is quite the isolating experience so i can relate to how you are feeling.
[Other] What have you been doing to keep yourself occupied?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] It's good that you are doing your best to take care of yourself.
[Questions] Have you been able to connect with friends or loved ones?
[Questions] It seems like you are doing what you can to stay connected with people. Did something happen that lead you to want to reach out for support?
[Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you were going through a really difficult time.
[Questions] What was going on for you at the start of the pandemic?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I can imagine how that would put you in a dark place in your life. Just know that you are not alone in this and that there are resources and opportunities out there.
[Other] Hello there
[Other] How are you today?
[Questions] I'm fine. Thank you. Can you tell me about what you're struggling with?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] I see. It seems like you're struggling to tell him something that would be very difficult for him to hear.
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you're worried not only about losing the baby, but also losing him.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] That's definitely understandable for someone in your situation.
[Providing Suggestions] I agree that it would be best to tell him sooner rather than later.
[Providing Suggestions] I would start from a place of love for yourself. Find a time when you would feel comfortable and at ease, and then schedule a time to talk with him.
[Other] You should definitely acknowledge his feelings in the moment.
[Information] You're welcome. If you need more help, i always recommend seeing a marriage and family therapist.
[Other] You're welcome. I hope you have a meaningful conversation and that you both come from a place of love and understanding.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] It can be sometimes, but you just have to follow your heart and trust that you'll find what you want.
[Other] You're welcome. Good bye.
[Questions] Hi :) Is there anything you'd like to talk about? Something on your mind?
[Information] Oh i am so sorry to hear that! Are you at least getting sick pay? If not, are you getting advice about help you might be able to access?
[Information] Oh i am so sorry to hear that! Are you at least getting sick pay? If not, are you getting advice about help you might be able to access?
[Other] (sorry for duplication, not sure what happened there!)
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you have been getting some assistance?
[Providing Suggestions] I see, so you are really financially struggling at the moment? Is there anywhere else you could apply for assistance? What about a foodbank?
[Self-disclosure] I hear you there - i spent a long time on hold for an official matter the other day. I guess that everyone is really desperate for help and advice right now.
[Self-disclosure] I hope that they can help you. My partner and i have used one before and they were very helpful. I felt a bit ashamed but there was no judgement at all.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] That sounds like a very positive thing to have done. I really hope that they pay some attention to you. This situation is not your fault!
[Self-disclosure] Yes they are run by lovely people. Ours gave us a pamphlet for cheap and easy to make recipes too.
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, at least it sounds like you have a good handle on this and are doing everything you can to help yourself, am i right?
[Information] That sounds very encouraging! It's amazing what you can make even with cheap food. Noodles , for instance, are very versatile :)
[Other] It's a very strange situation and i suspect that some of the authorities just feel overwhelmed and have no idea how to cope.
[Questions] That would be incredibly immoral of him. Do you feel that he is likely to do such a thing?
[Other] That is a very rational way to look at things. I really hope that it does not come to thank though! Thank you for talking and i wish you all the best for the coming months.
[Other] I am glad that you'd not roll over and accept ill treatment! Well done :)
[Other] I am afraid i need to leave now but thank you for talking :) (can you press the quit button and take the survey?) Best wishes!
[Affirmation and Reassurance] You too!
[Questions] I am well. What's going on?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] So it seems like you have been noticing some distance between you and a friend and it also seems like he/she is not putting as much as effort into your relationship as you are. It seems at times that you put in all the work and that it's one-sided. Does that sound about right?
[Reflection of feelings] This must be very hard on you.
[Questions] How does this make you feel?
[Self-disclosure] Sixteen years is a long time. I recently when through a similar situation with a friend. In my case, sitting down and communicating how i feel about the situation really did resolve many things. It made me understand why all of a sudden she was being distant and in the long run, it made our bond even stronger
[Providing Suggestions] I think you should try to honestly talk to her about how you feel and express to her that you are concerned. If she blows you off or ignores you, maybe consider rethinking your friendship. I know 16 years is a long time, but don't feel like you have to hold on to a relationship that is creating all of these negative feelings and unnecessary stress in your life. Friendships are meant to bring you up, encourage you, and hold you through the dark times. If she does not take your concerns seriously, consider taking a break and being distant.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I know this seems hard, but i believe that you can do it!
[Affirmation and Reassurance] People change sometimes and it is hard to understand. I want you to know that you are enough! You are smart and beautiful. Maybe it's time for this relationship to come to a close, but other people will come your way that will treat you like you deserve. I know it's painful now, but you will be stronger and better for going through this.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I think that is a good approach. You will get through this!
[Other] Anytime. I hope your feeling even a little better. Is there anything else i can help you with today?
[Other] Glad to be of service to you. If there is nothing else, feel free to click quit whenever your ready.
[Other] Aww, i am so glad that i was of help to you.
[Other] Take care! Bye
[Other] Hello
[Questions] How may i help you today?
[Questions] why?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Your friends have been leaving you out of christmas parties is that correct?
[Other] You knew nothing about the parties?
[Reflection of feelings] I understand how you are feeling i would feel the same way
[Other] They should not be having christmas parties right now with the covid going around bad
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I would not feel bad or terrible about it because you are doing the right thing
[Providing Suggestions] yes you should talk to him about it and see why he did not invite you
[Information] I hope they was wearing a mask and staying 6 feet at the party
[Providing Suggestions] I would just be straight forward and tell him you saw the photos of his christmas party
[Self-disclosure] Either way if you did know about the party it would not be best if you go just for your safety
[Providing Suggestions] yes i believe you should talk to him about that to because he was putting everyone at risk
[Information] which ever is more comfortable for you
[Providing Suggestions] Yes and just talk to him about how you feeling and see what he has to say
[Other] your welcome i hope it goes good and he listens
[Other] thank you merry christmas to you to and stay safe.
[Questions] Hi there, how is your day going?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Uh oh, you feel you have an anger issue? What's going on?
[Providing Suggestions] Is there anyone you can talk to about what you are going through?
[Reflection of feelings] How do you feel it is affecting your relationships?
[Providing Suggestions] I understand how it can feel like you have no one to talk to. Are you in school age, maybe a counselor could help?
[Questions] What do you mean?
[Self-disclosure] I was angry for a period of time after my husband passed away and i get where you are coming from
[Self-disclosure] I am also a single mom now
[Providing Suggestions] Day by day, focusing on my kids and how i want them to be happy. I also found a great support group in my community. Have you checked in to something like that?
[Questions] I know how hard it can be to live and feel alone. Do you have any pets?
[Providing Suggestions] I think that's a great idea! My dogs have really helped, they provide great comfort.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] That sounds like a really good start in helping with your loneliness, it's great that you are thinking of ideas that will help move you forward.
[Information] Thank you, that's nice to hear. Would you be interested in looking at the library for resources on groups or counseling?
[Information] If you feel less comfortable in person, i bet there are many groups and information online as well.
[Self-disclosure] At home. Yesterday was great weather here.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I have some errands to run, but i hope our chat helped and i hope you start feeling better. I think your idea to get a cat and also to check out some resources is a great start in helping you heal.
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you are experiencing problems at work? Please tell me about it, i am happy to listen.
[Other] I am very sorry to hear that - trouble with workmates, especially those who are in a higher position, can make things very miserable can't they?
[Providing Suggestions] Have you considered going over her head and putting in a complaint? Especially if she is making everyone else miserable as well. Someone more senior might be able to do something.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Please try to stay positive - bullies never prosper in the long term. I think that you need to talk to your co-workers about this and see if you can come to some sort of arrangement between you
[Questions] Alternatively, have you ever considered seeking another job? I know that that might feel like selling out but you might be happier somewhere else
[Reflection of feelings] I feel that that is fair enough. You should not be working to make up for her failures and i hear you saying that you feel that this is w hat is happening?
[Other] (sorry was afk give me a second to catch up :))
[Other] I really feel that you have grounds for a formal complaint. Just her being incapable is bad enough but bullying too is unacceptable
[Other] Anonymous reporting sounds like a good thing, as long as it's not being abused. This sounds like a very good time to use it though
[Other] I hope i have been able to give you some good advice here!
[Other] You are most welcome, enjoy your day!
[Questions] Hello! How can i encourage you tonight?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you have a lot on your mind and you are losing sleep over it?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sorry to hear that. It can be a bit stressful to think you may lose your job.
[Self-disclosure] I have found there are ways to calm myself down when things in my life seem very uncertain.
[Other] I make a list of the things i can do - and the things i can't. Then you can have goals. And if you can work on a goal, for example, if you need to write a resume, you start working on that a little bit every day until it's done. But if there is nothing you can do about the situation, you have to pray to god to help you then let it go. If you can not fix it now, you will only make yourself sick thinking about it.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] It is much more difficult for me to remain focused and positive when i lose sleep. I have had to focus on self care, finding a friend to talk about my problems with, not someone who will tell me what to do, but support me. So you need a good support system. And i find things like prayer, bible reading, nice soft sheets to sleep on and some herbal tea like sleepy time help me relax before bedtime.
[Self-disclosure] And be kind to yourself, no one likes to lose a job, it's unsettling. Do try to tell yourself things that are true to encourage yourself, like you will find another job, it might be uncomfortable and hard, but it actually might work out for your good in the long term. I always found better jobs, but at the time i lost my job, i felt as if the world was ending.
[Reflection of feelings] You aren't in an easy place, but this can actually work out for your good. I think if you focus on the good that can happen, that might help your more. I would be concerned too, but if you even start looking for a job now, that might help you become more confident. I do encourage you to set goals.
[Other] I have found that the hard times are often stepping stones to better things, however at the time, all it feels like is hard times! lol
[Self-disclosure] I'm an older lady - i'm almost 60. So i've had a lot of jobs, retired now, but i remember when my husband kept getting threatened with job layoffs. It was really disheartening for him.
[Self-disclosure] If i had to do it over again, i would have encouraged him more to get that resume out and look for another job. The threat of losing his job was always hanging over his head. Yeah, it's not worth it my friend. Be pro active.
[Other] I would also encourage you to get outside and run, or walk or play with the kids or do exercise everyday, because if you are tired physically, that helps reduce stress and helps you sleep.
[Other] Sometimes a pay cut in the right company is a stepping stone in the door, my husband lost a lucrative job one time, he started at a company washing dishes in his 40s, i kid you not, but he wound up moving up and retired early.
[Other] He wanted to provide for our family, so he was willing to humble himself, looking back, i'm amazed. But he moved up. Once in that organization, he had lots of open doors, so you never know what god has in store for you.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand that. Perhaps get together with her and look for ways to cut out spending. These are tough times. Even one car, or chicken instead of steak or canceling netflix or something like that. A few steps back is not failure, it can be prioritizing things in a difficult time.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I do want to assure you that even though i don't know you, you sound intelligent and caring and obviously wanting to provide for your family. That's honorable. These are difficult times, i do encourage you to write things down because sometimes stress clouds our eyes and if you set goals and brainstorm, you will be amazed at what you can come up with.
[Questions] Hello! What would you like to talk about today?
[Questions] Can you tell me more about this anxiety?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] I am here, it seems that you don't feel like you've studied enough. Is that correct?
[Providing Suggestions] It truly depends on the subject! There are online sites that provide free additional instruction
[Questions] Can you tell me what the class is?
[Providing Suggestions] Khan academy is absolutely fantastic! It is extremely helpful and accurate since it is run by educators.
[Self-disclosure] No but i am a former math teacher and i would give them to my students!
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I am so glad! I know online school is stressful but i think you can do it.
[Providing Suggestions] I can recommend other resources if you'd like.
[Providing Suggestions] If this is an upper level math course, you can go to university sites! They always have lessons
[Other] Of course! Did you have any other questions?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Good luck studying! You're capable of doing well!
[Other] You can terminate the convo at any time!
[Questions] Would you want to go further into whats causing this anxiety?
[Information] Well, have you tried online platforms like mturk?
[Providing Suggestions] It can be bit tough to get into in the beginning, but with a decent amount of work and determination it might be able to help with your monetary problems.
[Providing Suggestions] I hear you on that. I am disabled and the extra income helps a lot for my family. Unfortunately until the pandemic ends a part time job might not be in your best interest for now. Ebay flipping takes some time to get into as well but could help.
[Information] Its actually very easy now. You can print out the slips at home and they tell you how much it will be. I have done it a few times, the last time was only a couple months a go.
[Providing Suggestions] I am sorry for that. Yea having a nest egg is ideal, but i know how hard it can be. I think with the extra cash and space it may be a big help to those anxiety issues. Do you drive a lot as it is now?
[Providing Suggestions] Well at least you are not putting to much wear on them now. Have you checked with local governments for assistance? Even with things like medication?
[Information] Believe me never hurts to try. A penny you save on something else can be a penny that goes into your savings
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Wow thats pretty good. Yeah it is. It seems you are very proactive about this which is really good.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I am very glad i could be of some help. I truly believe you have this handled.
[Other] You as well!
[Questions] I'm sorry to hear that. Do you know why you feel depressed and sad?
[Providing Suggestions] Have you tried taking some deep breaths to help you right now?
[Questions] Tell me more about the poor relationships you have
[Information] Are you able to talk to anyone about this? Someone who will at least listen to you talk?
[Providing Suggestions] Maybe you could take one person aside by themselves and talk privately about your feeling?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, just wait for the right time when the person is alone and ask if you could talk.
[Providing Suggestions] Remember to take deep breaths, wait for the right time and see if that works for you. I know you can do it.
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] I have faith in you. Is there anything else we need to talk about?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Remember, the outcome may not be perfect but slowly things will come together. Take it one step at a time.
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] See if the conversation gives you some insight on how things could be better. Maybe you could see things from someone else's perspective.
[Questions] Would you be willing to give it a try?
[Providing Suggestions] Also, if that works, then build from there. Remain calm and little by little talk about your concerns.
[Information] Get some good sleep the night before you try having the conversation so you are at your best.
[Other] You are welcome.
[Other] Hi, how are you?
[Questions] Would you mind possibly telling me a bit more about it? I am not all that familiar with that, and it does sound intriguing.
[Reflection of feelings] I tend to worry at times too, and it almost always helps to talk about it with someone.
[Questions] Do you usually get along well with your parents?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds to me like you're thinking that you've disappointed your parents by falling behind in class a little?
[Self-disclosure] I felt much the same way back when i was in college. My parents paid my way through school, and even got me to pursue a major that i had no interest in.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I can tell you from personal experience and seeing others who've gone through similar events, your parents just may be a little upset right now, but they love you and really just want you to have a good and happy life. It sounds cheesy, i know, but it is actually true.
[Providing Suggestions] I know it may sound silly, but you may want to start meditating on a regular basis. It truly does make a big difference in the amount of stress and worrying that you will find yourself not doing nearly so often.
[Information] Studies on the benefits of meditation, mindfulness, and yoga have been pretty definitive in the fact that it drops people's stress levels, and thus their cortisol levels, and makes a real change for the better. I do it myself and it really has worked well for me.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] That's great! You'll be so glad that you did, i just know it.
[Other] Please make sure you get back in touch with me to let me know if it was beneficial for you as well.
[Questions] You might also want to consider having an honest conversation about this with your parents. Are you able to have conversations like that with them?
[Information] You may be surprised at how understanding parents can be when you open up to them
[Other] Thank you for sharing with me, and i truly hope that it has helped you even just a little.
[Other] Thank you for sharing with me, and i truly hope that it has helped you even just a little.
[Questions] Hello! How are you feeling today?
[Self-disclosure] You are a very good parent to care and worry. I get it, i am a mom myself! Is your child doing digital learning or in person?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I can see how that is challenging
[Questions] Is it the same teacher for both?
[Reflection of feelings] That has to be really frusterating not having just one teacher you can go to in order to see if there is anyway to help your child not struggle
[Providing Suggestions] Perhaps you can find out which classes your child struggles with and contact the teacher(s) or school to set up a conference? I know some schools even have peer tutors they say help pair students with!
[Self-disclosure] My children are five and eight. My eight year old spent about ten hours doing digital learning the other day when in-perosn was closed. I was so frusterated. I let her pick a movie and snack when she was done to reward her for finishing.
[Providing Suggestions] Have you looked into any edulational or learning games?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] There is nothing wrong with rewarding your child for doing good in school or getting thier work done! :)
[Information] I have done that with my kids. Technology is such a huge part of children's lives these days, they will play a videogame in a heart beat. I don't think they even realize they are learning sometimes!
[Information] check out the website adventure academy. They have things for all ages/grades!
[Other] I'm glad i could help! You too!
[Questions] okay, what is it?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I think it is natural for a a parent to feel guilty when they are having thier child do something the child doesn't want to do. i think the benefits outweigh the negatives though. i think finding a way to make studying fun could be a win-win. you are a good parent for wanting the best for your child!
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I think there should be more parents out there that care about their children and their children's future like you do. keep up the good work!
[Questions] Hello, i am doing well, thank you for asking :-) What can i help you with tonight?
[Questions] I'm sorry to hear that. Is there a particular issue that you are upset about?
[Reflection of feelings] That's a really rough situation to deal with, your emotions are totally understandable.
[Questions] What was the reason she gave for breaking up with you?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Cultural differences can be insurmountable obstacles in a relationship for some people.
[Reflection of feelings] Getting over the good parts of a relationship can be hard. For some reason our brains like to obsess over the good parts like they were the only part of the relationship, and ignore all of the problems.
[Providing Suggestions] Taking up an exercise you like can be helpful. You can work on yourself and blow off steam.
[Information] Know also that you will find someone new when it's right, and that you will create a new synergy with that new person. We don't ever love anyone the same way twice.
[Providing Suggestions] That sounds like fun! Whatever you do, take care of your heart
[Other] About going to jamaica? Sounds lovely
[Questions] How are you doing today?
[Questions] I am well thank you. What would you like to talk about today?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand you have been having some issues with your old friend. Is that correct>
[Questions] Why do you feel that she does not want to talk you?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand that it is difficult to feel ignored. Could it be that she is not receiving your messages?
[Self-disclosure] It could be that she is not much of a texter. I personally don't answer calls but always reply to texts.
[Providing Suggestions] That sounds like a plan. That way you can speak to her, and you can even find out if she has some issues with texting.
[Questions] Do you have mutual friends?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] You can do it. Otherwise you may not find out what is going on.
[Providing Suggestions] Definitely. If it doesn't go as planned then perhaps you can think about other friends you can talk to.
[Other] I am glad i had the opportunity to chat with you. I wish you all the best.
[Other] You too.
[Questions] Doing well thanks and yourself?
[Questions] What's going on?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Oh i definitely know the feeling of not hanging out with friends. This has really been a bad year!
[Questions] Do you ever zoom with your friends?
[Self-disclosure] Messaging on facebook isn't quite as fun as hanging out in person. I use zoom to meetup with family and friends. I had never heard of it until this pandemic hit.
[Providing Suggestions] I most certainly do know! I just think to myself daily that this vaccine is going to get things back to normal. Hang on, we're almost there. In the meantime i suggest zoom. It really does make things somewhat less isolating.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] We're almost there!
[Self-disclosure] And if you have an iphone facetime some folks. Zoom and facetime are my friends now. lol i almost daily at least facetime my best friend. Especially in the evenings.
[Providing Suggestions] I would try it. Also meetup is doing virtual meetings.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] You're welcome! We have to look out for one another!
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Sounds good! You're more than welcome. You do the same
[Questions] how are you doing. What is troubling you dear
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] if i get you right, you are fired because of your health condition
[Affirmation and Reassurance] that's really hard, i can feel your fear
[Self-disclosure] i lost my job also because of covid economy inpact
[Information] have you try looking another job from nearby
[Other] that's a good news
[Providing Suggestions] you can also go online
[Affirmation and Reassurance] you are welcome. you have to keep it together for a while before you get one. But i believe it will be soon
[Self-disclosure] i have found a part-time job also, it doesn't pay much but its better than nothing
[Other] exactly
[Questions] Hello, how can i help you today?
[Questions] Tell me more. What has you feeling sad?
[Self-disclosure] I completely understand. I am also going through the same. I have not left my house in weeks. While i am able to work from home, my hours were also cut.
[Questions] What would help you feel better about the situation? What are you doing to pass the time?
[Providing Suggestions] I also live alone. So i can understand how you are feeling. You are not alone in this situation. Although you may feel that way. Have you tried connecting with friends via text, video call, etc? Sometimes that helps, even if it's not the same as face to face.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Don't feel like you need to do a lot to be productive. Even getting up to watch tv is still getting up to do something. That's still a win.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] That's good. Keep that connection. It's not going to be the same due to the circumstances. But at least you are seeking to keep that connection, and that is a good thing.
[Providing Suggestions] What i found helped somewhat was joining a few social groups online. find something you like and find a group related to that. For example, i love horror movies, so i joined a horror movie group on facebook. While it's not face to face, it is a good opportunity to just connect with others about a common interest.
[Self-disclosure] I am hoping they get the vaccine going as well. But i am hoping they get it right, and not just rush to get something out there that may or may not work.
[Providing Suggestions] Im sure you can! Maybe write a blog about the repairs you can do to your home, since you are there anyway.
[Self-disclosure] I use facebook, instagram, and sometimes tiktok
[Self-disclosure] You should do mini videos on easy things to diy on tiktok.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] right! That is a great idea!
[Self-disclosure] not really. what i do is record the video beforehand, and then upload it.
[Providing Suggestions] But you can also record it straight to the app.
[Providing Suggestions] You can also do the same on snapchat
[Providing Suggestions] Yes, if you are doing longer videos, i recommend youtube. What you can do, is do a short clip on tiktoc and then in that clip instruct viewers to follow your youtube channel
[Other] Yes snap chat dissappears after it's viewed
[Other] Sure, my pleasure!
[Questions]  why do you feel that way?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] You seem really concerned about gun rights. Does that sound possible?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Thank you for your service. I can understand how that might be a difficult situation for you, especially with your experiences. How are you handling this situation?
[Providing Suggestions] You are welcome. That is really kind of you to want to protect your children from harm. It seems like you feel the best way to do this is through owning guns? Have you thought of any alternatives, since the votes have been cast?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] That is a good point you bring up about the quickness and efficiency of protection that guns can provide.
[Questions] How you thought of any other alternatives that could help your family, regarding the process of obtaining guns during a biden presidency?
[Providing Suggestions] Definitely! My first step would be understanding the gun policy that biden would have and confirming the new process. Does that sound like something that could be a good starting point?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I think you are just being careful and protective of your family. That is very honorable of a veteran like yourself.
[Questions] Yes, that sounds like the case. Are there any practices that have helped you when you're worried?
[Self-disclosure] Don't be embarrassed! To be honest, i have had experiences with some of those, including deep breathing. I also find it helpful.
[Self-disclosure] Of course! I am glad to share and help :)
[Other] Yes it was nice. I hope you have a great holiday season as well!
[Self-disclosure] I have been in that same situation before! I had the exact feelings you are! But after realizing how much i studied it helped me relax.
[Questions] Have you talked to your teachers about your worrying?
[Information] From what i have seen, people who have noticed they are having issues tend to come out ahead! Its great that you are thinking about how to get through this.
[Self-disclosure] I also get into slumps with being productive and motivation, i was told when that happens that i just need to take a step back and relax for a little bit.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] That's really great! I bet you are closer than you think to finishing those deadlines.
[Questions] When you are usually in a last minute crunch, what do you do to get past it?
[Providing Suggestions] I know some people look for tutors, or others taking the same classes for inputs on work that has to be turned in.
[Providing Suggestions] Is there an easy way for you to put the other preoccupations to the side so they are not so distracting?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Thats good! I bet that would help out a lot, that tends to be the case for me!
[Information] Thats good, research has shown that moving our distractions to the side allows us to focus more on the task at hand!
[Other] I am glad to hear that! I bet you can get those deadlines finished no problem.
[Other] I am glad i was able to help, you got this, i bet you don't have this issue again.
[Other] Well thank you! Let me know if you need help with anything else!
[Other] You as well!
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Hi. I see that you are upset. I have been at times as well.
[Reflection of feelings] What about your friend is making you upset?
[Information] What about him has made you feel betrayed?
[Self-disclosure] I have been in situations where similar comments have been made.
[Questions] Could you tell him that he could see a professional that could help him quit drinking?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] What ways could you find some support groups for your friend regarding his issues?
[Providing Suggestions] It might be worthwhile to recommend him look into getting some counseling about his issues that you seem to think are a real issue.
[Questions] How long has this isolating been occurring?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I know that your friend has a lot of issues to address, but you can give him an impetus to look at changing for the better.
[Information] There is a group like aa (alcoholics anonymous) that could be a great support for your friend.
[Self-disclosure] I have dealt with friends like this, but the sooner he can get help for his alcohol issues, it could better your relationship with him.
[Providing Suggestions] I am glad to provide suggestions like aa and other support groups.
[Questions] What else can i help you with?
[Questions] Were my suggestions helpful?
[Reflection of feelings] I feel that the right suggestions can help. Alcohol can be a real issue with maintaining meaningful relationships.
[Providing Suggestions] You could also be part of his support group if he agrees to aa.
[Information] No, i don't feel it is betrayal. You care about him.
[Questions] Do you have any more questions or concerns for me to reflect on?
[Other] I am doing pretty well. There's a beautiful sunset outside right now. How are you?
[Self-disclosure] Yep. Me too. My dad just got sick and i was worried out of my mind waiting for his test results to come back. Thankfully they were negative.
[Questions] Is there anything else you've been worried about?
[Questions] Are you working right now?
[Questions] Do you have a backup plan if you get laid off?
[Questions] I see. Do you have anyone who would be willing to offer you support if you needed it, like your parents?
[Providing Suggestions] It might be worth talking to them ahead of time. I'm sure they would understand.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Lots of people are in a similar situation right now.
[Self-disclosure] Yes. I live in california, which is kind of strict.
[Self-disclosure] I'm perfectly happy to be at home, though. I'm on break from school and i have plenty of projects and stuff to work on here.
[Reflection of feelings] I really sympathize with everyone who has to support themselves right now, though. It majorly sucks.
[Self-disclosure] Yep. I'm off for a whole two months, because my school didn't want anyone coming back after thanksgiving.
[Other] Also, i know i don't really know you, but can i write you a christmas card?
[Other] If you would rather not give out your name/address i totally understand. :)
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand that you are feeling like your professors don't see you as a person with feelings. What happened to make you feel this way?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] That's hard to feel like they are treating you like a number when you are working so hard. Have you talked to them about it?
[Self-disclosure] I had a similar experience in my college days. It was very difficult to have so much pressure to succeed and feel so alone. You can do though because you are working hard and want to succeed.
[Reflection of feelings] I see you are anxious about this when talking to you, but have you thought about getting some support from other students in your position?
[Information] Also sometimes just stepping back and taking some deep breaths can help to alleviate some anxieties. Have you tried that ever?
[Other] That is reassuring that it worked before for you and can work again.
[Reflection of feelings] College can be quite a change from the protective atmosphere of home. Have you tried any support groups or religious groups for encouragement?
[Self-disclosure] I was a part of a religious group in college and they were very supportive even praying for me on exam days. I felt they helped me with my success by planting seeds of positive feedback to me.
[Other] Are you starting to feel better about the situation?
[Other] You are welcome. I wish you well.
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] What are these feelings related to?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Im sorry for that, so added stress with her and her daughter being around?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] That is really rough and im sorry that your parents are taking sides and not looking at this from the whole situation.
[Other] So she is not there currently?
[Providing Suggestions] Well i can see you really care for your niece. It also seems like your sister is a toxic person who is using your family. It may be rough not being able to see your niece but it might be better for your own well being to have this space from her.
[Information] No keep going, sometimes just getting it out there helps
[Other] Yea usually never anything good about loss. I am glad you are doing better now though. Hopefully she can turn herself around
[Other] Oh not a problem at all!
[Other] Thank you very much. And thank you for sharing!
[Other] Hello how are you
[Questions] Great how is everything going for you
[Questions] Why do you feel isolated?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] I completely understand. I don't worked at a school and the teachers did not receive much support. Is that what is making you stuggle at work?
[Questions] Is it the lack of support at the school that is causing you to struggle?
[Questions] Sorry i asked about the isolation and you mentioned the reason was the work. So im just trying to confirm your lack of support at school is the reason for your struggle. Does the feeling of isolation stem from that?
[Other] Understandable.do they have any kind of help groups at your school?
[Information] Is there something you have in mind that might help your situation and theyre not listening?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Agreed with 20 some students after repeatedly trying with a student you cannot keep stopping the lecture to discipline. Of course there should be some help in place.
[Providing Suggestions] Ive seen this first hand and teachers really have their hands full. I know most parents are busy, but have you tried to connect with the parents maybe they can step in and talk to their children.
[Providing Suggestions] There are also several community groups with different kids of occupations. Ive seen multiple ones for teachers helping each other by sharing their own methods. That might help with some ideas.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] No problem. I hope you find some better ideas. You are not alone and remember you have one of the hardest jobs out there!
[Other] Same to you!
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry to hear that. Tell me more about what is making you feel pressured.
[Questions] That sounds like a stressful situation so it is natural to feel anxious. Are there any coping mechanisms you have tried that have helped in the past?
[Providing Suggestions] I know when i am in a stressful it helps to take an occasional break to do some deep breathing exercises and meditation. Have you tried any of these techniques?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Yes, that sounds like a great idea. I think yoga can be very beneficial in managing stress.
[Providing Suggestions] I think it is important to remember to take care of yourself. That means eating right and exercising. I found from my own experience of going through a stressful situation that exercise was the best technique for managing stress.
[Providing Suggestions] I understand that there are days where it feels non stop and it can be hard to find the time. Excercising early in the morning is a great idea because it gets you off to a good start to the day. I like the idea of including friends too. That can be a great motivator.
[Reflection of feelings] Indeed it is hard to be perfect and no one is. It sounds as though you are very hard on yourself. From a practical standpoint, you could try talking about your grades with your professors and have a discussion about how to improve your grades.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] You're welcome. I know this is hard but you have got this.
[Questions] Thank you. That is kind of you to say. I hope my suggestions help. Is there anything else you want to talk about?
[Other] I am so glad to hear that.
[Other] I hope you have a great day
[Other] Hi there! How may i support you today?
[Reflection of feelings] That must be hard. Covid has really turned our world upside down! What type of occupation are you in?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] That's great! It is because of front-line workers and people like you that we are at least able to put a fight against the pandemic! My hat tip to you for choosing your line of profession.
[Information] Major pharma companies have already announced vaccines and they have a success rate of more than 90 -95%. So my friend, this too shall pass.
[Reflection of feelings] I feel the same way too! Modern technology is indistinguishable from magic!
[Affirmation and Reassurance] So hang in there, with the us election results and the vaccine announcement, things will surely get better.
[Information] If you are in north america, the pandemic rate will go high due to combination with flu season, but at the end of the day, we will develop herd immunity.
[Reflection of feelings] Well, nobody is, my friend! But it's part of life. And ya, morons will exist all over the world.
[Providing Suggestions] Since you are young, even if you contract, you will recover pretty easily. But, god forbid, if you do, please practice social distancing and stay home!
[Providing Suggestions] I hope you don't get sick. Just follow what your supervisors advise you to and apply your own knowledge into practice. I am sure it will work out great for you and your friends!
[Other] Friends make life worth living and i am sure you all will do great. Good luck!
[Affirmation and Reassurance] That's the spirit!
[Questions] Is there anything else i can help you with today?
[Other] Sure! Take care :)
[Questions] Can you tell me what has caused you to be in a bad mood?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I see, it can be very frustrating when friends don't listen.
[Self-disclosure] I too have had friends upset me at times.
[Providing Suggestions] Have you tried telling your friends that it upsets you when they don't listen to you?
[Information] Studies show that if people confront their issues with others directly, the likelihood of a positive result is more than likely.
[Other] It seems like you are feeling better since we spoke. I am glad! And look the sun is coming out!
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Hey, how are you today?
[Other] I'm doing well, can't complain.
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, you're issue is that you want to stop wearing your mask due to the reduce cases of covid
[Providing Suggestions] If you county, region, city has reduce cases than i don't see why you should wear mask unless your local government told you to do so.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Personally, that's your decision to make if you want to wear the mask.
[Providing Suggestions] Wearing a mask is supposed to keep you safe from the airborne disease and others. Maybe you can practice other safety measures. Staying 6 fts away, sanitizing yourself.
[Providing Suggestions] If it's troubling you, maybe you can extra safety measures to protect yourself without the use of a mask.
[Information] Could you have a mask with you, just in case a situation arises?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Maybe find a compromise? Wear when you are around people, and take it off when you are not. Or try limiting interacting with a large group?
[Questions] I'm sorry. Can you tell me what happened?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand you are upset and caught off guard.
[Questions] What was his reasoning?
[Reflection of feelings] Oh wow.... Thats horrible. How long were you with him? Sometimes people can surpise us.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Just a bad year all around. I'm so sorry this has happened.. and right before christmas.
[Providing Suggestions] Hopefully you can return his present if you got him one already.
[Providing Suggestions] Do you have any plans for christmas? Maybe keeping yourself busy and distracted through the holidays will help.
[Reflection of feelings] Yes. At least you found out before such a huge life choice. Its also better you found out now at 2 years instead of 4 years.
[Reflection of feelings] I'm sure you are filled with mixed emotions. Anyone would be.
[Reflection of feelings] Like you said, you dont live with him. So it will be much easier to cut ties
[Other] You are very welcome. I wish you the best of luck
[Other] I hope you have a merry christmas
[Questions] hello there, beautiful day isn't it?
[Questions] oh no what's wrong?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] You seem really concerned about your mom! why haven't you been able to call her?
[Self-disclosure] I know it is sooo hard. My mom lives so far away and i can't see her too because of covid. the only thing that makes me feel a little bit better is that am not putting her at harm's way when i visit her
[Questions] How are your boys feeling about it?
[Providing Suggestions] To be fair roblox is pretty fun. Have you seen those videos on facebook where family members visit their families from behind the window? What do you think your husband will think about that?
[Other] hello
[Questions] i'm good, what is troubling you this afternoon?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] if i get you clearly, you mean your friend disappointed you. how?
[Self-disclosure] i have a hard time with my friends too sometimes
[Information] i used to give them time to cool off, when they are back to their senses, they will contact me and apologize
[Questions] what causes the argument in the first place ?
[Providing Suggestions] oh,jst give them time to reflect on what happen, they will definitely reach out to you, but you also have to make an effort to forgo the situation because they see you raising your voice on them as a sign of command of seniority.
[Providing Suggestions] exactly, that will also gives you the necessary time to know how to react to their forthcoming apologies
[Self-disclosure] even if they haven't reach out, that doesn't mean they are not sorry
[Information] just be patient with them
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] yes, give them time
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] same to you friend
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sorry to hear you are freaking out. Perhaps a friendly listening ear can encourage you?
[Questions] Why are you freaking out?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Sometimes just a friend to hear you out and encourage you can really make a difference. Life has its ups and down.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] That's a difficult decision you have made.
[Questions] Have you tried to talk to him about the problem? Or a counselor?
[Self-disclosure] I have worked at a domestic violence shelter before, the most dangerous time to leave a situation like this is when you leave. Do you have a plan in place?
[Providing Suggestions] My husband used to be very controlling as well, i dragged him to counseling. He changed. He bucked at first, but eventually he went. We have gone a few times off and on over 20 years. We both came from broken homes.
[Questions] Has he hurt you physically? or is he mainly emotionally abusive?
[Reflection of feelings] I'm glad to hear that. I can understand that you would be really stressed at this time, however, i do encourage you to get a good plan in place, and definitely get counseling.
[Self-disclosure] Yes, i had child abuse in my life too, i really think counseling saved our marriage, 3 times. But like, i said, he didn't want to go. However, the first time, i did leave and stay with a friend, and that convinced him i was serious.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I wish i could fix this, but i can't. The road will be rocky and i don't know how i would have made it without people to encourage and support me, so i'm glad a friend is willing to have you stay with them until you can get on your feet.
[Self-disclosure] My husband really loved me, but coming from a broken home, he lost his mom when he was 12, so he thought controlling me was the solution, very messed up, but he had to learn to see that.
[Self-disclosure] He feared i would die or leave him or something, but once he saw that, and realized what he was doing was hurting me and making me want to leave, he changed. But honestly, i have never understood men and why they dont' see life the way we do. Sometimes it takes that objective person to help them see it.
[Reflection of feelings] Ouch! That sounds painful to look at.
[Information] People who truly love others become willing to change. Sometimes it takes a drastic measure to wake them up, like leaving. He has not heard you, so many he will "hear" it when you leave. But please be careful and have a plan.
[Questions] How long have you been married?
[Other] That's a long time. I will say a prayer for your safety and for you to get some help, hopefully he will join you. Marriage is a lot of work, but it can't be one person, it has to be two.
[Providing Suggestions] Don't leave anything in writing around until after you leave.
[Providing Suggestions] I believe in the power of prayer too. The serenity prayer is a good one to help me let go of my fears and do what i can, leaving the rest to god.
[Information] If i worry and get upset, then i waste energy, i have had to learn to get distracted if i find myself on that worry train, call a friend, go for a walk, just not obsess, it goes nowhere.
[Providing Suggestions] And i urge you to get a counselor.
[Other] You are welcome. Watch your thinking, when it goes off track, take charge, change your thinking, get up and move about and do something else because it's not healthy for you to worry. As you said, you freak out, and that is not good for you or your children.
[Information] It's a rough situation, it will be difficult, you seem very intelligent, have thought about this, are working on a plan and are able to discuss it. That's a big plus on yoru side.
[Other] I'm glad to hear it. Keep the faith, all will be well in due time! Sometimes rough roads really work out, but it never feels that way! You have a good night! :d
[Questions] How are you tonight?
[Questions] What do you think they are planning?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] So just to make sure i understand what is going on, you think your friend is about to blackmail you and you are worried about it.
[Reflection of feelings] I can tell you are very worried about this
[Providing Suggestions] Have you talked to him about the situation and let him know your concerns? Often times it helps to clear the air and make sure things are okay
[Providing Suggestions] Have you thought about asking other friends of yours to see if this was something he has done in the past?
[Questions] Do you know any of his other friends?
[Self-disclosure] I would be open and honest about what i thought and why i was worried about him doing this.
[Providing Suggestions] Let him know you are worried about your friendship and you have some concerns over what he is going to do because you didn't want him to move in with you.
[Self-disclosure] Honestly if they were my friend and they were going to treat me this way, i wouldn't want them to be my friend at all.
[Providing Suggestions] What if you just told people what you thought he wanted to release about you? Getting ahead of things is super helpful most times.
[Other] I think it will help!
[Other] Not a problem! If you have any other questions just reach out again!@
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] You feel like what happened does not make any sense right?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] This can be very difficult but you can try not to dwell or bask in the sadness
[Self-disclosure] I was jilted by my lover some years ago, it was hard but i had friends who stood by me and always were there for me
[Providing Suggestions] Maybe you can try talking to them about it if you feel comfortable enough doing so. It just might be helpful
[Information] From the knowledge i have, when people open up about their feelings they tend to heal faster.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] It might take time but it's great that you feel optimistic now about getting over it. It's a step in the right diection
[Providing Suggestions] Do you have hobbies? If you do, it helps to engage in what you love doing, they will help you feel better.
[Questions] Hello, don't worry, i am here to help. Could you tell me what is going on?
[Reflection of feelings] I can definetely imagine how stressful the last week of school can be, especially taking 5 courses instead of 4.
[Providing Suggestions] However, don't let this situation scare you or ruin your holidays. There are ways to cope with said stress.
[Providing Suggestions] First of all, do you have some academic counselor you can talk to? Help you organize your ideas or classwork? Can you refer to professors or fellow classmates for help?
[Questions] Are you confident in your abilities to succeed in those classes or you think you might lack the materials or knowledge? Or perhaps time?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] It's okto be moody given the circumstances and the stress you are going through, and i think that you should attemp to complete all the assignments even if you don't get a 100% on them.
[Information] That will show the professors that you are responsible and care about the subject or perhaps your major.
[Information] Accomplishing to submit everything will also make you feel good with yourself!
[Affirmation and Reassurance] It's important than you take your time.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand that college can be financially demanding.
[Information] You need to think that you will have a secure job once you graduate, and every debt will be eventually paid off even if biden doesn't forgive it.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Try to remain optimistic and shake away the anxiety, it won't do you any good.
[Questions] Do you feel better after talking about all of this?
[Information] Not at all, i think what you are experiencing is completely normal, and you just have to cope with it in the most optimistic way possible. Maybe getting your assignments done in time will be helpful for your anxiety. After that, you will have tons of time to spend with friends, family, or simply leisure time to do what you enjoy.
[Other] It is a pleasure to help : )
[Questions]  okay. I am very sorry to hear that! Do you want to tell me more about that?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I really feel you there. Holidays are so hard.. especially with the way this year has been. Anything specific?
[Questions] Do you feel scared for your own self? Or of the situation in general? I'm sorry to hear that. Relationships with parents can be very difficult sometimes.
[Self-disclosure] I'm around college age as well and also live at home. So i can understand your struggle.
[Self-disclosure] It's like we live the same life. I also have no car to escape! It seems so small, but it's such a huge stressor when you feel trapped in an environment you're not positive in. I feel your pain and i empathize with you completely.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] It'll be hard but i hope you can make it through it throughout the holidays and enjoy yourself some. Are there any pros to going back home? Any pets?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like covid- 19 is going to be a personal stressor for you. It's such a strange thing to have to live with already, the pandemic, and i'm sorry that it might end up pushing you where you don't want to be.
[Providing Suggestions] Could you bring your hamster home with you? Even the smallest things could help a place feel more loving
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I don't think you're selfish at all. You have feelings you are entitled to have and are expressing them which is healthy and i encourage that behavior!
[Providing Suggestions] Good! I know how hard this situation can be. Very nerve wracking. The smallest things, even a hamster, can be so beneficial.
[Reflection of feelings] You sound like a very determined person in making this trip as stress free as possible. I commend you for that! Maybe you could have your niece over often to play with your hamster just to soften the stress of being there
[Providing Suggestions] Is uber an option for you? I know there's a lot of rideshare services but they're not always financially reasonable. But that could be a way to get away if you ever need too!
[Self-disclosure] Sometimes i forget little things like that to help myself whenever i get too involved in the emotional aspect of things. I'm glad i could suggest it to you!
[Other] Of course! I hope you do as well and happy holidays!

[Information] I get it, distractions can be challenging to overcome at times. Have you thought about going to a library, or a book store?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] If it helps you study then the library may be worth the time and effort. Sometimes we can stress out over worrying about not having enough time to study. But trust the work you have done and you will know if it is enough.
[Information] Yes, and it wasn't easy but with hard work, it is completely doable. And you have the power within yourself.
[Providing Suggestions] Sometimes it is not about the amount of studying, but the way you study. I like reading my textbooks and highlighting the important parts and then rewriting them so they become ingrained in me. But let us not jump the gun, you haven't failed anything.
[Providing Suggestions] Don't forget to breathe. Exams are stressful but i would suggest don't cram everything to the last minute. Usually the hour before the exam, i do something else.
[Information] Stay calm, believe in yourself, start your studying early so you are not cramming everything in the last few days.
[Information] Walk outside, away from the students waiting for their tests.
[Questions] Is there anything else i can help you with?
[Other] Goodnight and good luck.
[Other] Good afternoon! How are you today?
[Other] I am good. How are you feeling?
[Questions] I am so sorry to hear that. What is making you feel lonely?
[Questions] Do you live alone?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand you feeling lonely in the hotel. What is in virginia for you?
[Questions] What is going to fix your truck issue in virginia?
[Questions] I see. Do you have family and friends in virginia?
[Reflection of feelings] I understand that. The virus is causing issues for everyone, you are not alone there.
[Questions] Will your issue be fixed in virginia?
[Providing Suggestions] I absolutely understand that. I hope you get your issue fixed. Have you tried connecting with groups on social media. I know there are groups on facebook and instagram for people who are lonely and just want to chat and connect with each other.
[Reflection of feelings] Ekkk, forget that. Maybe try searching 30 and over chat groups, or 40 and over chat groups, etc...
[Providing Suggestions] Hmmm, i know there are many lonely seniors out there. I have seen senior groups. Try rewording different ways in google: senior chat, senior groups, senior social media, lonely seniors. Anytime someone mentions money, say bye!
[Providing Suggestions] nextdoor.com is good for connecting too. plus if you move you just sign up in your new area and chat with new people. And it is free.
[Other] Have a great day and best of luck to you!
[Questions] When did this start?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] That sounds really hard. Depression is tough to manage.
[Reflection of feelings] I can feel that you have a lot of pent up frustration with this, especially after trying so hard.
[Information] Lot of research shows that feelings of anger can morph into depression, that is not uncommon.
[Reflection of feelings] I can tell that this has been very hard for you, especially since it has gone on so long.
[Questions] Why do you think you were angry?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Ouch, that sounds really hurtful, but i know you are doing your best now.
[Self-disclosure] My parents divorced when i was young, but now i understand it has given me the opportunity to grow stronger as an adult
[Providing Suggestions] Do you participate in any peer support groups? Those can really help let that emotion release?
[Providing Suggestions] Of course, there's lots of information available online for local meetings. Perhaps trying a group like aca could really connect you with your inner child.
[Other] Of course!
[Questions] i am good thank you how are you doing?
[Questions] how may i help you today?
[Other] what seems to be making it hard to communicate with him?
[Other] how long has this been going on?
[Reflection of feelings] i can understand how you are feeling
[Providing Suggestions] have you tried to talk to him and tell him about how you are feeling about when you two argue
[Information] Communication is key in a marriage without that the marriage will start to fail and i do not want to see that happen
[Providing Suggestions] you two need to sit down and have a serious discussion about the way your marriage is going
[Providing Suggestions] have you two ever considered seeing a marriage counselor?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] don't feel put down or let it get to you because as long as you trying in a marriage that is what matters and just keep trying
[Other] The only way you two can work it out is by communicating that is the main thing to do in a situation like that.
[Other] no problem that is what i am here for
[Other] Hello, i'm sorry i didn't reply faster.
[Questions] How can i help?
[Questions] How can i help?
[Questions] I understand. What are you struggling with concerning time management?
[Self-disclosure] I have also struggled with time management. I have found that reminders on my phone, and a planner have been most beneficial to me personally. I understand every situation is different. Do you have a deadline you're trying to meet?
[Reflection of feelings] I can see how this would be very overwhelming. I have a child learning virtually as well. Similarly, i am a student. I am not working on my masters degree... I can't even imagine.
[Providing Suggestions] Is your child old enough to do some of it on their own? I have "independent" or "together" next to each task. I purchased a large magnetic chalk board for our fridge. If your child is to young to do this i could see how this would be much more challenging for you.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I completely understand how you feel. Virtual learning has affected our daily goals, though we are doing prerecorded lessons. That does make it easier i am sure. I have a 10 and 2 year old at home with me. One thing that has helped me is support groups. There are so many moms going through the same thing we are at this time.
[Information] You are not alone in this. You could take the 3 year old to another room if possible and work on phonics/numbers, then help the older children during naptime. Then maybe they could help entertain the 3 year old while you work on your own schoolwork? This is similar to my daily schedule... but as you know with kids you have to go with the flow most of the time.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] It helps so much to talk to other moms who understand. Being a mom is hard enough without all the added extra stress of 2020. It sounds like you're doing the best you can, and your kids will remember that in the long run. You can do this!
[Questions] Why do you feel like your life is empty?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm really sorry to hear that.
[Questions] Was this a recent event?
[Questions] Wow, that's really a hard thing to deal with isn't it?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Hmm, it sounds like she isn't being completely honest with you.
[Self-disclosure] I've been left before too. It was one of the most painful experiences of my life.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Maybe she did like the attention, but that is her own issue. It really doesn't have anything to do with you.
[Information] Sometimes low self worth makes a person seek that kind of exterior validation from someone else.
[Questions] That doesn't sound healthy to you, does it?
[Questions] so, do you think that was the only way she could connect with you, through sex?
[Questions] Is this your first serious relationship?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you enjoyed the sex a lot, but you also want an emotional connection to a woman.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Ok, be well.
[Reflection of feelings] You must be very frustrated from feeling unable to do something.
[Self-disclosure] I remember when my mother was having end of life mental declining issues. I understand feeling as if the person is changing and having unusual moods and mood swings.
[Questions] Do you have anyone you can talk to?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] You are feeling the way anybody in your situation would fee like. It must be helpful to have a husband who listens and can be supportive when he is there.
[Questions] Have you always had sleep issues?
[Reflection of feelings] Being upset can make someones mind race and make it really difficult to rest or get any sleep at all.
[Questions] Have you ever gone through anything like this before?
[Self-disclosure] I can relate to being close to someone who is addicted. It can feel very sad and lonely at times. I would want to change the person in my life but just has to learn to let go instead. It is a process that takes years to learn.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, i understand how it can feel like our children are always our babies and we want to fix everything for them. Sometimes it feels like we can change them or re raise them if we just do more for them.
[Providing Suggestions] Have you had the chance to speak to a close friend or pastor about this situation?
[Providing Suggestions] You are very self aware and have good insight. I notice that you are very in touch with your feelings. You can use writing as a way to release emotions and express yourself, as you are now.
[Information] Yes, i can recommend a journal on amazon that i also use. Thank you for sharing with me today.
[Information] Please reach back out anytime.
[Other] Thank you!
[Questions] Hey there! How are you feeling?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Correct me if i'm wrong, but it sounds like your husband may be controlling you a little and you're expressing reasonable emotions because of it. and okay!
[Questions] Why do you think he talks to you this way?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Okay that is perfectly okay. You are fine. If you need me to assist you in any way just send a question mark.
[Self-disclosure] I've been in a similar situation. I was with someone who was controlling in a lot of aspects so i can feel your pain and struggle. I can feel your anger too, and i imagine that it is alot. It is not your fault, and you aren't allowing this to happen to you. It is out of your control. Don't ever blame yourself.
[Questions] How can i assist you?
[Self-disclosure] I was in it for two years before i broke away from it. It was so hard but liberating to leave!
[Providing Suggestions] I could suggest you see a private doctor to talk about this with, if that is something you are able to do. Or see one with your husband. Maybe he needs a third party to help mediate the problems you guys are having.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] That's very hard to deal with. And i am so sorry you are dealing with this. Do you feel safe?
[Reflection of feelings] I can tell this situation stresses you out and probably consumes a lot of your day to day energy. I sympathize with you and your children. What happens when you try talking with him about this?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I commend you for speaking up for yourself despite his responses. I hope you hold on to that strength for as long as you can. It will empower you
[Information] Okay i will be praying for you and i hope the best outcome for you possible. Please know there are domestic hotlines you can call if need be. I hope you enjoy your night.
[Other] Thank you!
[Questions] May i ask how long you two have been friends?
[Reflection of feelings] To be honest my friend that was in a gang is now serving a life sentence in prison for murder. I was too late to help save him from that life, you still have a chance to help save yours
[Providing Suggestions] May i suggest you two pick up a hobby together. Play some online video games together or go out to a skate park and have fun.
[Information] Show them that you care by wanting to hang out with them and there is more to life than gang activity. There is no hope in dope.
[Providing Suggestions] You could write a letter to them stating how much you care and dont want them to be in a gang. Give them an ultimatum that it is either you or the gang. Your friend cant be your friend while in the gang. So he will either have to keep your friendship or go his seperate way with gang
[Information] If your friend does not want your friendship after that then maybe he was not your friend in the first place
[Information] you may see him as a friend but he may see you as an object to get what he wants
[Questions] Does that sound like a good solution to you?
[Questions] I like to unwind and relax by listening to some music that i enjoy. Do you enjoy music as well?
[Information] Other things that help me reduce stress is my hobby of playing music. That keeps my mind preoccupied. Other kinds of way to reduce stress are by exercising. A simple run around the block can really help blow off some steam.
[Information] Also playing a sport can help reduce stress, some people like to do other things to reduce stress like reading. I do not know what you enjoy so you will have to figure out exactly what to do that will reduce your stress.
[Reflection of feelings] I like a nice cold drink as well, i enjoy fruit punch.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Im sure you can turn that frown upside down if you thought about something funny. :)
[Information] Well i wish you the best of luck in life and hope you have a great rest of your day :)
[Information] you have to hit finish
[Questions] How can i help you?
[Self-disclosure] I am so sorry to hear that. I have previously lost a job and i know how distressing it is. Can you tell me about it?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you are feeling as though you are letting your family down?
[Questions] I can understand how that feels. Have you tried to talk to them about it?
[Reflection of feelings] Do you feel as though you are going through all of this on your own?
[Information] Do you know that there are people out there who can help you? Have you tried contacting some charitable organisations that will provide counselling for free?
[Self-disclosure] They can be really very helpful. I have reached out to them myself previously
[Other] The job market is very uncertain right now but please know that you are not alone!
[Questions] Have you considered retraining?
[Self-disclosure] There is no such thing as too old! I have a friend who trained as a teacher at age fifty.
[Providing Suggestions] There are a lot of options out there. Perhaps you should see a career advisor?
[Questions] Do you have any ideas of things that you'd like to do?
[Questions] Do you have any ideas of things that you'd like to do?
[Reflection of feelings] So you feel that you could retrain?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I know how frightening it can be. But if you strike out there, you never know!
[Other] Well if you don't try you will never know what might have happened. I wish you all the very best with it.
[Questions] You are most welcome. Is there anything else that i can help you with?
[Questions] Good evening, how are you?
[Questions] What can i help you out with tonight?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] That sounds like a complicated situation
[Questions] Is the project something you will become responsible for?
[Questions] Is that a responsibility you want to have, or is it a burden that is being thrust upon you?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, i think if it's truly a responsibility you want, you will work to live up to it as best you can.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] That's excellent, not many people can say that! It's starting to sound more and more like an opportunity for you to prove yourself :-)
[Self-disclosure] That's an unfortunate part of most group projects, i hate to say. Interpersonal communication can be so hard. I have been a project manager in the past, and found that you have to consider person xyz did not wake up in the morning and decide to make your life harder.
[Other] And as long as you can keep things polite and professional, everyone gets to go home separately, thankfully! Haha
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Foster the people around you that can provide you support, be a reliable producer and leader, and you will find that those that don't like you will move on. And, most importantly, you can only control how you respond/behave. If someone wants to instigate conflict, that will reflect poorly upon them.
[Other] You can only engage with what abuse and hostility you accept. If you smile in response, it will make you feel better than if you internalize their aggression.
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] I am really sorry to hear that your going through that right now, what happened tonight ?
[Questions] was there an argument
[Reflection of feelings] I totally understand having financial issues , this is a hard time for so many people. I am sensing that this has been esspecially hard on your relationship, did one of you lose a job?

[Affirmation and Reassurance] it sounds to me like you are willing to do what it takes to be sucsessfull
[Reflection of feelings] oh im sorry to hear that, how does that make you feel? also there are also many midfullness activities you can use to reduce your level of stress and axiety like meditation
[Affirmation and Reassurance] its really hard to do everything all by yourself. It seems like you are a good person with a good heart.
[Questions] Oh no, how long had you been together?
[Questions] Wow, that's horrible. How do you feel about it?
[Self-disclosure] I understand, i was with my wife for 4 years before she up and left without saying a word.
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] That can be a hard thing to go through especially this time of year
[Questions] Do you have any family?
[Questions] Friends closeby?
[Questions] Hobbies?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] What kind of work do you do?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Well you know, i have found sometimes that we need time to ourselves in order to fully understand how we need to grow.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I have always tried to think of things in a positive way. This way even when something really bad happens, it doesn't seem so bad as to overwhelm us from recovering.
[Questions] I'm actually trying to get into the software development field, how do you like it?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well, there is plenty of opportunity out there. Not too mention, being in that profession, you probably aren't hurting for money.
[Providing Suggestions] You can use that stress that has been building up to find a new outlet for the stress.
[Self-disclosure] I completely understand. My wife used to think i was just playing on the computer all day, lol.
[Self-disclosure] I run
[Self-disclosure] Every morning, i jog about 2 miles. It is awesome to get the blood going and a great way to start the day.
[Other] I feel so much more relaxed after running and it seems that nothing can hurt me after that.
[Providing Suggestions] I do know how a programming job can take away from some social aspects of your life, maybe try and go to a bar, or somewhere social to get out some.
[Providing Suggestions] No problem, i hope i have helped you some.
[Other] Happy holidays!

[Providing Suggestions] You may exchange information with your colleagues and see if there is anything you don't know.

[Providing Suggestions] The best strategy is to find another place. I don't have the intention to play with the office politics.
[Information] Hi

[Reflection of feelings] I can tell how anxious and upset that is making you feel.
[Self-disclosure] I can definitely understand that feeling as i had an ex who cheated on me and had a child with another man, so i know how hard that is.
[Providing Suggestions] I focused a lot on myself and making more time to do some of the hobbies that i didn't get a chance to do when we were together.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I know things are really hard right now, but i know you will make it through this!
[Providing Suggestions] Have you talked to her since she broke up with you? Sometimes it helps to talk with your ex so you can get closure on the situation.
[Providing Suggestions] I understand that, have you tried to talk to a friend or family member who has gone through the same thing?
[Other] Doing that definitely helped me too!
[Other] I think that would definitely help too!

[Self-disclosure] i had to do the course over again in my situation
[Information] yes, the student union can help because they used to receive similar complaints like yours every time
[Providing Suggestions] student union is a very powerful body in any institution. the school authority always fear their anger. so go through them first
[Affirmation and Reassurance] don't lose hope on getting your due result.
[Providing Suggestions] if the student union followed it up and their outcome is that you have to take it again, then you have to take it again
[Affirmation and Reassurance] that doesn't make you a failure. what doesn't kill you makes you stronger
[Other] you are very welcome
[Questions] What's wrong?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand. I, too, am struggling with covid-19. It's going to be difficult not to see family during the holidays. We'll get through this, though, don't you think.
[Questions] Have you spent time trying to communicate with friends and family online or by messaging and telephone?
[Providing Suggestions] Maybe there is a way to find ways to have fun online with your friends and family. We actually played games together recently. Is that something you could do to reconnect?

[Affirmation and Reassurance] It must be even harder during times of the virus!
[Questions] I am sorry to hear that, have you thought about seeing a counselor through the internet?

[Providing Suggestions] Do you have any self-care activities that you enjoy doing? This could help feelings of depression. Even taking some time out of the week to do something you enjoy can help lift up one's mood.
[Questions] Well i am glad to hear that you have some activities you enjoy! In relation to your son, how do you feel when he plays video games constantly?
[Providing Suggestions] Have you ever thought about using the video games as an incentive. For example, if he finishes his homework, he can play for two hours or something?
[Questions] It is good to hear that the video games did not get in the way of him completing his work. Do you have any other ideas as to what hobbies makes him happy or interested?
[Providing Suggestions] I think starting with the school counselor is a great idea, i feel she will have more of an idea of how your son functions in school and maybe give ideas to helping his mood.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, no problem! I hope you can find a solution to helping your son.
[Questions] Hello, how are you?

[Other] You're welcome! I hope everything works out for the both of you.

[Other] Well, firstly i think you need to accept that this is not your fault and that at the moment the world situation is beyond your control.
[Questions] Are you able to cope financially whilst you are out of work?
[Providing Suggestions] Perhaps you could take on some gig work just to earn a little extra spare cash?
[Self-disclosure] I understand. I have been in the same situation and i know how frightening it is. Have you though of consulting agencies such as food banks that can help you temporarily?

[Providing Suggestions] I think it might be a good idea for you to consult your doctor? It sounds as though you might be suffering from depression.

[Providing Suggestions] Would you be prepared to take on a job that is outside of your normal field and income bracket, just temporarily?
[Questions] I know that it is very difficult with so many businesses being forced to close. Would you be prepared to do delivery work, perhaps?
[Providing Suggestions] Yes. Or most restaurants are offering take out services at the moment so there will be delivery services out there

[Other] It sounds a little as though her behaviour is toxic. Does the friendship really mean that much to you?
[Reflection of feelings] So you feel that the friendship is worth fighting for, but she is not being responsive?
[Questions] Was there one specific thing that triggered this or had it been coming for a long time?
[Information] Would you consider having some counselling together? Perhaps talk through what is going on?
[Other] She has no right to issue you with an ultimatum like that.
[Other] I really feel as though you are the one putting all the effort in here and she is just making selfish demands on you.
[Providing Suggestions] Perhaps it is time to try and make some new friends? Join a society or something?
[Other] I think you know deep down what is the best thing to do. You don't need selfish people in your life.
[Other] You have your boyfriend though :). He will always be there for you - and not treat you as badly as she has!
[Other] I don't think you owe her an explanation after how she has behaved. Leave her to make the next move
[Other] I hope i have been able to help you a little!
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I know that you must feel that this could be a problem but i think you will be able to just ignore her. I am afraid i must leave for my next appointment now.

[Reflection of feelings] I can understand the emotion part as mine had lawyer who that encouraged her to seek more.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I am not wanting to be with anyone because my x is jealous and wants me alone. I desire romance but feel that supporting two wives is too much.
[Reflection of feelings] Long walks alone sucks. I want to so much hold a hand walking, but i know she will try to stop any involvement
[Providing Suggestions] I realize the desire to be alone, but find a female friend that wants to spend time together to keep you from feeling like you are going it alone.
[Providing Suggestions] Make a friendd 1st then the romance may come. There are a lot of lonely women who desire friendship as well.

[Reflection of feelings] I can imagine that you must be really hurt amongst a number of other feelings. Hearing you tell me that he has done this is upsetting to me as well.
[Self-disclosure] I've had the same thing done to me and i can remember being extremely distraught.
[Other] Do you mind me asking what the argument was about? If you don't mind going into a little more detail, i may be able to help you more.
[Other] That must be such a terrible feeling. So the argument started because you were sick, he didn't check in on you at all for that entire day, and when you expressed your feelings to him, it turned into an argument?
[Other] Has he ever acted this way towards you before? For example, has he ever shown a lack of empathy towards you like this in the past?
[Other] Are you still there?
[Providing Suggestions] Have you tried reaching out to him throughout the course of these past two weeks to see if he would respond?
[Other] I would really like to help you find a solution to this problem, but it appears as though you may not be active anymore. I'm going to wait a few more minute for you to respond before cancelling the chat. In the event that i don't hear back from you, i wish you the best!

[Restatement or Paraphrasing] that is a hard position to be in.
[Other] are you saying that the woman you are marrying is not the woman who is pregnant?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Do you think you should tell your fiancÃ©?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] What do you think you will do. Tell your finance or not tell your fiance.

[Self-disclosure] Every man would be scared in your situation. This is a fact. But some with tell and some will not.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I cannot tell you what to do. I can tell you that you will make vows to your wife, to be honest and faithful. You have to decide if you want to lie or tell the truth
[Affirmation and Reassurance] neither is wrong or right
[Reflection of feelings] I think you are making a good step towards a healthy marriage
[Other] good luck
[Questions] Hi. How are you today?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] it's really a terrible time. you are definitely not alone in feeling that way. Is there something specific going on?
[Providing Suggestions] Is there a way you can write down in an email why the extra work is required and what specifically needs to get done in order to make this project successful for both you and your manager?
[Self-disclosure] I have had managers like that. It's so frustrating. Is there a way you can have an in-person meeting and show her how extra help will make her look good? Otherwise what i've done in the past is go over my immediate manager's head - or called a meeting with 3 of us.
[Self-disclosure] I have had managers like that. It's so frustrating. Is there a way you can have an in-person meeting and show her how extra help will make her look good? Otherwise what i've done in the past is go over my immediate manager's head - or called a meeting with 3 of us.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I feel for you because i've been there and i completely understand how you feel. And yes including her and her manager won't make her feel as though you're going behind her back.
[Questions] ridiculing you how? that's never ok
[Affirmation and Reassurance] you have every right to feel upset about that.
[Providing Suggestions] I wonder why hr isn't interested. Have you put it in writing? No one likes a paper trail that isn't acknowledged.
[Reflection of feelings] that has to be a horrible feeling to be in such a hostile work environment. do you have coworkers who would be willing to back you up?
[Information] there's definitely power in numbers!
[Providing Suggestions] if it's really that bad is there a way to get a transfer?
[Reflection of feelings] yes and that just makes things so much worse.
[Providing Suggestions] maybe seek out someone more senior in a different department who can help
[Self-disclosure] When i had a toxic manager i went in and did my work and kept to myself as much as possible. But it does help to have allies throughout the company too!
[Affirmation and Reassurance] you're very welcome. I definitely understand what you're dealing with!
[Other] you, too. enjoy the rest of the weekend!
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] \so you have had a breakup recently and you are feeling down about it
[Questions] So are you doubting that you made the right decision or are you just feeling sadness at the loss you are feeling right now
[Affirmation and Reassurance] You must have had good reason's to have made the decision to breakup and to have initiated it. Its normal to doubt yourself afterwards. You may want to remind yourself of the reasons that you came to your decision you did. Im sure the reasons are still valid
[Self-disclosure] So you felt the need to have some time to fucus on your own goals and growth and now you feel like you could have stayed in the relationship and you are doubting that you needed to take the step of breaking up. In my experience at times we need to be single for self growth and i have found that personal growth usual thrives when i am single.
[Providing Suggestions] I think you are feeling a loss even though you feel that at this time you need to be alone to focus on your own growth. When you had the conversation about this breakup were you honest about why you need the space and that your problem was not with the relationship but with maybe the timing. I think with communication and after growth perhaps by keeping the door open with this person maybe you can have some sort of relationship in the future even if its friendship or maybe more. You are doing what is right for yourself at the given time
[Providing Suggestions] I have been in both situations before the one who needed space and also as the one who was broken up with. I think right now the best thing you can do for you and the person is to stick with your decision and give them time they also may need space to process and deal with the breakup and growth for themselves without really letting go you won't be able to grow in time you can have a conversation and ask but it might be six months down the road wait for them to come to you they have asked for time as you did too soon
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Focusing on yourself sounds like the best thing you can do. Start on that list of self improvements you want to make. Connect with friends you may have lost touch with. Your going to be great
[Other] Your welcome and i love that you are so dedicated to your development
[Questions] Hi, how are you?
[Questions] Ok, how may i help you?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, it is the same for most of the people. Any thing particular bothering you?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, you cannot go out due to covid and that makes you frustrated. Is that correct?

[Providing Suggestions] Well, the chinese are to blame for covid-19 spreading to many countries.

[Restatement or Paraphrasing] You want to go into manufacturing?
[Self-disclosure] I used to be in manufacturing, so i would look into that field on job boards.
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] The government does not prohibit people from going outside.
[Providing Suggestions] I suggest going to job boards and submitting resumes to recruiters who can help you.
[Questions] Have i helped you feel less anxiety and fear?
[Self-disclosure] I used to feel fear about my job security, but i learned and took professional development courses.
[Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you are feeling better. :). I am glad to help you feel better about the economy.
[Questions] Are you fluent in reading and writing english?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] That is a positive. The more literate in english that you are, the better your job chances.
[Questions] Do you need any more help?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I feel that you are thinking about things correctly.
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, you no longer need my help?
[Self-disclosure] I used to be part of a support group online as well.
[Providing Suggestions] You can click the red finish and exit button to end the support session today. Merry christmas.
[Questions] Hello. What seems to be the issue?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] You said you generally don't trust family or people in general?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Just people who are close to you?
[Self-disclosure] I have had a hard time trusting strangers, but that is not a big problem.
[Self-disclosure] I used to be the same way, but i learned about how to make and keep close friends.
[Providing Suggestions] I joined volunteer groups to help others. I made friends with like-minded people who volunteered to make a difference.
[Information] Groups like habitat for humanity or unicef will help you to build long-lasting friendships.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] It just takes finding the right volunteer groups and being willing to be pro-active.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] You can do it. I have faith that you can use volunteering as the right method.
[Self-disclosure] Exactly, volunteering is a great option. And there are many organizations to join.
[Questions] Did you need help with anything else?
[Self-disclosure] I understand the adhd. There are support groups that can help you make friends; especially with adhd, etc.
[Providing Suggestions] Using tools to build houses helps to release endorphins, which can release anxiety.
[Providing Suggestions] There is a group called, "harry house" that provides support to those with adhd and anxiety.
[Questions] Surely. Is there anything else you need help with?
[Providing Suggestions] No, habitat fir humanity has car pools.
[Providing Suggestions] They are a good group to help you build meaningful relationships.
[Self-disclosure] I used to do a hour at a time; maybe one or twice a week.
[Providing Suggestions] Would you be interested in something like hfh?
[Information] Yes, you can sign up online to join a project.
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Yes, you can volunteer locally; hfh is nationwide.
[Questions] Any other questions? I am glad to assist.
[Self-disclosure] I have done volunteer work; people want to be friends with those who care and know how to use a nail and hammer. :)
[Providing Suggestions] It may also help to contribute some money to keep the organization going.
[Reflection of feelings] I felt great after making friends and building homes for low income people.
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Im sorry to hear that, has there been anything going to cause the increase?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] That is really rough, though it is good you recognize it. A lot of people do not.
[Providing Suggestions] Have you tried to talk to a professional. It is very prevalent that mothers experiencing this do.
[Self-disclosure] As long as you recognize that it is a much more common thing that people go through, that is a great start. I experienced it with my second child as well.
[Self-disclosure] There is no harm getting a second opinion. I never did take medication, i found a good therapist to talk too.
[Providing Suggestions] Yeah that you cant, and i cant stress how good it is that you realize it. I would definitely go for a second opinion. Or even search for therapists that specialize in it in your area. Never have been a fan of using medicine as the first go unless really needed.
[Questions] And whats the worst a little talking can do for you. Has talking to other moms been helpful at all?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] At least he is trying, as i said before, even with it being so common, it is a mystery to most.
[Other] Yeah its a rough cycle, you get down on yourself for feeling down.
[Providing Suggestions] Well, i am glad you want to do something about it. I hope you do follow up with a second opinion, or maybe even support groups in your area.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Great, thats wonderful news. I think you are on the right track to being yourself again.
[Questions] I'm sorry to hear about that, have you discussed how it made you feel with your partner?
[Questions] If it were entirely up to you how would you like your relationship to proceed from here?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you worry you will not be able to trust him in the future because of this no matter what his future actions are, do you think there is anything he could do or say that would change this?
[Questions] What would you define as full commitment from him?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] That's true and divorce can be expensive. You mentioned before that you feel like you are with him mostly because you are lonely, is that how your relationship started?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I don't think you are naive, you are clearly asking yourself the right questions about building a future with him
[Questions] Do you have friends and family around that could help distract you from the loneliness until you find someone you are comfortable starting a family with?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Of course! There also probably community resources where you can meet new people and explore new interests! Unfortunately i think a lot of that might have to wait til covid passes
[Questions] Of course! Anything else on your mind you would like to discuss?
[Self-disclosure] I know, i've heard some people have found success with zoom dates.
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] So it sounds like you've been struggling with finding a new job. It's never easy looking for a new job during these times. Why do you think you're having trouble?
[Information] It sounds like you're motivated and dealing with a lot. Is there a specific job that you had in mind or are you applying to different kinds of jobs?
[Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you really care to want to be close to home. Have you talked with someone locally about jobs that would allow you to stay close to home?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Stay motivated. If one opportunity doesn't get your desired response you may be even closer to finding the right job for you. Keep pushing on and know that if one opportunity doesn't work out a positive attitude will make all the difference. Just because you haven't found one yet doesn't mean you won't.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Your faith is healthy and gives you purpose. Similarly you have to believe that the dots will connect in your favor. Maybe you can't connect them looking forward, but looking backwards you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.
[Providing Suggestions] It can be frustrating to focus on your last job, especially if you haven't found a new one yet. Perhaps once you find a new job your disappointment with the last one won't be so disappointing anymore. If the new job is better you wouldn't have found it working the last job.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] It's great that you're staying productive and improving yourself. If your desire to improve yourself is as strong as your desire to find a new job i'm confident you will.
[Other] Don't let your past define you, let your present choices pave a new path into the future.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm confident you will.
[Questions] What do you mean?
[Reflection of feelings] Thanks for sharing with me. Take care now.
[Questions] sure, what seems to be the problem
[Self-disclosure] I had the same issue with my friends as well
[Self-disclosure] We stopped getting together and going out places cause they were all closed
[Providing Suggestions] We now have weekly video call meetings instead, it helps us stay connected
[Information] Not at all, we use a program called skype, that's free. You can use it on your phone or pc
[Information] Pick a time you'll both be available, and you'll both need the program. It's quite easy to use and there will be youtube videos that'll help you set it up, should you need it
[Self-disclosure] We usually just chat about our week or get advice on normal things, sometimes we'll play a drinking game and be goofy together.
[Self-disclosure] Drinking isn't a requirement, usually we'll just chat if we don't feel like drinking
[Reflection of feelings] I can understand that and it's definitely frustrating. But it'll be so much better once you can see other other again, cause absence makes the heart grow fonder
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, i always like to look for the positive in any given situation
[Questions] Can you tell me more about what you're feeling?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] It seems like you are concerned about your son's future and wellbeing. Is this correct?
[Questions] Does your son have any other supports in his life?
[Questions] Does your son have any other supports in his life?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I see how that could be intensely difficult to deal with. I think your strength is admirable
[Reflection of feelings] From our communications it seems you are feeling anxious and stressed as well.
[Providing Suggestions] Yes, i would suggest you find a place where you are comforted and feel safe. You are in a difficult situation and it is clear you need emotional support as well. Do you know of any support groups in your area?
[Other] I think that is a wonderful idea. You deserve to feel safe and supported too.
[Information] Some people find comfort in hobbies as well. Do you have any comforting hobbies?
[Questions] Are there other people in your life who can watch the children too?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] You are certainly in a frustrating situation, but it is clear you are a good caregiver.
[Providing Suggestions] There are some charitable organizations which may be able to provide some relief in your area. Have you looked into those?
[Self-disclosure] I personally have been a caregiver in the past and it can be exhausting. You are a strong person.
[Questions] Hello. Im doing good. How are you doing?
[Questions] Hello. Im doing good. How are you doing?
[Questions] Why. Can you talknto me about it?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand how are you feeling. Its not that easy going through this pandemic
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I know how are you feeling. Im kind of going in the same situation. But you have to keep calm. You have to look things at this way, maybe this is an opportunity to socialize more with your love ones and start learning new things at home. I believe god put us in this situation to appreciate more our surroundings
[Providing Suggestions] Have you ever try to talk to your love one at home? Or maybe take time to communicate more with your friends?
[Self-disclosure] Well i dont know when this is going to end but if we let this isolation win the we are going to get worse. So i would recommend to share time with your love one and clear your mind and take out all the negative things away. Right now im talking a lot with my brother and me and him never get along. So this is a huge step
[Providing Suggestions] Another thing i can recomend is try to read some books. That will help. I dont like reading but im doing it and sometimes by doing it relaxed me and get me to another place
[Information] Well, i love fictions and mystery. Right now i just finished "the davinci code".
[Providing Suggestions] I dont want to sound like a christian fanatic or something like that but the bible helps too. Ever since this pandemic started i started read it and it helped me a lot
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you are not having a good time at the moment? Can you tell me a little more about why?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Your wife has been unfaithful to you? I can understand why you are so angry about that!
[Providing Suggestions] Have the two of you considered counselling or are things beyond redemption now?
[Self-disclosure] I am really sorry to hear that. I do know personally how betrayed you feel when you are cheated on. All i can say is, it does get better.
[Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you have been treated very poorly, do you agree with that?
[Questions] Are there potential financial issues or do you think she'd be prepared to reach an amicable settlement?
[Other] She does not seem to have stayed true to her marriage vows for very long!
[Information] Wow that is very difficult. There are support agencies out there that can help the friends and family of addicts, i believe. Would you consider them?
[Questions] That sounds really very controlling. Do you think that maybe she is regretting her decision but does not know what to do about it?
[Other] Sometimes, unfortunately, you do just have to walk away from a mess if there's nothing you can do about it
[Self-disclosure] I hear you on that. Unfortunately some people do not take commitment as seriously as others. I have been in that position and had my heart broken.
[Self-disclosure] Oh, i tracked him down and smashed his head in with an axe. Okay no i didn't really. I just told myself that i was better off without him and it was his loss. I am not sure i totally believed myself though.
[Other] (sorry i had a temporary internet connection problem there)
[Other] I would advise not to rush into anything else too quickly.
[Other] You need to give yourself time to grieve before you move on
[Other] I hope that i have been able to be of some comfort to you!
[Other] And you too! Goodbye :)
[Other] Hello! How are you doing today?
[Other] I'm doing well. How can i help you today?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand why this would be frustrating for you. Its good that you are trying to support her. Have you talked to her about the way you're feeling?
[Questions] Do you think she is any sort of danger that someone should know about?
[Questions] That is understandable. Do you think it's to the point where maybe you should say something to her about it? Even if you might sound a bit critical?
[Providing Suggestions] Have you thought of any possible solutions you think could possibly work to fix this issue?
[Other] All of the above!
[Information] Do you think these issues are serious enough to get a proffessional involved?
[Providing Suggestions] You may have to make a decision and determine how big her issues are.
[Providing Suggestions] Yes. How do you feel about doing that? Do you think that would help?
[Providing Suggestions] I think that sounds like a great thing! Sometimes we just need to get together and help out the people we love going through tough times!
[Other] Of course! I hope all goes well!
[Other] You as well!
[Other] Bye!
[Questions] How are you doing today?
[Questions] I'm sorry to hear that. Why do feel that way?
[Reflection of feelings] I understand why you'd feel that way, we should be treated with respect especially with our partners.
[Questions] What a terrible thing to say. How do you answer him?
[Providing Suggestions] I'm sorry about what you're going through. It might be a good idea to take some time away from him and for yourself, if that would be possible. Do you have friends or family near you?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] It really is a difficult situation for everybody. It sounds like you're all feeling stressed and cooped in too, does that sound right?
[Providing Suggestions] It would be good if you can reach out to your friends and let them know how you're feeling. Try to make some time for yourself and let your husband know how you really feel.
[Other] I hope you keep safe out there too.
[Other] I think it's different for everybody and you'll have to find out for yourself what you would want going forward. Stay strong, it sounds like you're a great parent!
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] I can certainly understand your anxiety you are feeling right now
[Questions] I would be freaking out too. When is your final . How far away is it?
[Questions] Do you have someone you could possibly study with?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I can certainly appreciate how overwhelmed you are feeling . When do you get a break from work?
[Self-disclosure] You are doing an amazing job and most people couldn't handle it . I completely understand as a mom of two boys myself.
[Other] You have so much on your plate and hard to keep up with everything you are telling me. .lol. Please may i have a moment to try to help you
[Providing Suggestions] Could you ask a family member or neighbor or babysitter to help out ? Give you time to concentrate on paper
[Providing Suggestions] Or how old is your oldest ? Could they watch or help get everyone to bed earlier?
[Providing Suggestions] Do you have any pto at work you could maybe ask boss to take off now ? or leave early ? Or take tomorrow off to have 3 day weekend to recuperiate?
[Other] I think that is a creative great way to gain some time and maybe ask debbie to help with bedtime?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh my you certainly do have a lot on your plate but after my conversation with you i know you can do it ! You are amazing and don't let anyone tell you differently/
[Providing Suggestions] Sounds like a plan
[Other] We all need extra money lol but especially you with being a single mom with 3 kids.
[Other] youre welcome good luck and i ll say a pray for you
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] I am sorry to hear that youre feeling depressed, do you want to say whats going on?
[Questions] Sorry to hear, if you dont mind me asking, why did the break up happen?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I have been there myself with a cheating spouse, i know it is rough, especially so close to when it happened. I can assure you it does get better though.
[Providing Suggestions] I think the best thing you can do right now is distance yourself from her.
[Providing Suggestions] It sounds like she is acting toxic and you do not need that right now. I am happy to help and talk with you, but might i suggest going to a local therapist or counselor?
[Information] It will take time, the best way to let it not control you is by talking about it. You gain control over it that way.
[Providing Suggestions] Being betrayed by someone you love is one of the biggest heart breaks there is. You have to focus on yourself and healing that wound.
[Providing Suggestions] It will not be a quick process that i can heal right now. The best way to get out of it is to see a professional. There are many out there that work on a sliding scale or even free. They will help guide you back to yourself.
[Information] Yes do you have any specific goals right now? or even hobbies you are working on?
[Providing Suggestions] I know its tough out there for that as well. I had gotten furloughed but i didnt let pride get in the way and took what i could find for now.
[Providing Suggestions] Have you worked on your resume or updated it?
[Providing Suggestions] I worked in restaurants all my life. Its tough but rewarding. Have you looked into moving up from a supervisor? Maybe talk with your boss?
[Other] Hello are you there?
[Providing Suggestions] Well you have the real world experience which is good. Have you thought about doing some classes at a local community college to help with that?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] That is great news! See we already got your mind off your girlfriend. You'll be back on your feet stronger than ever soon.
[Other] you are very welcome. Is there anything else on your mind?
[Providing Suggestions] Well, that is good, just start focusing on yourself, my friend.
[Providing Suggestions] Great, feel free to end the chat so you can get started on bettering yourself!
[Other] You are welcome
[Questions] Are you having trouble with ending the chat?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Hey there! That's a good topic to talk about. With everything that's been going on, it's normal to feel some anxiety.
[Questions] What do you think is one thing that is giving you a lot of anxiety?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sorry to hear that. Similar stuff is happening where i am, and i also get anxious hearing about it.
[Questions] What do you feel when you feel on guard and paranoid? Try to say some more about that if you can.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Thanks, i hope the same for you.
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Yeah, that makes sense. When this was all new, the uncertainty probably made for more anxiety. Now that we know some more about what is safe and what isn't, maybe less so. But it doesn't mean the anxiety is gone, of course. It's still around in our day-to-day lives.
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well said. You feel stuck. The usual things you would do now are just not available to you.
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] I can rephrase some of this, if you don't mind. In a way, you're talking about activities that you may have used (gym, hikes, etc) to keep yourself in a good mood. Now that those don't seem available, you just don't have those opportunities to boost your mood. It makes sense that you would be feeling this way.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I think you explained yourself really well. Thanks for sharing how you've been feeling.
[Questions] Do you think if you went ahead anyway to the gym or out for runs that you would feel guilty for doing them?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Yeah, and that just throws on another layer of why things are difficult right now. No one wants to feel guilty for doing things that could help themselves.
[Questions] Have you ever heard of the phrase "black or white thinking?" as in, thinking that situations or people are completely good or completely bad? Or completely doable or completely impossible?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Yeah, i think i understand that too. I get really frustrated hearing about people hosting big parties or not wearing masks because they think it's no big deal. They're putting others at risk.
[Information] I think we all do black-or-white thinking to some extent. We're wired to try and make sense of the world, and maybe our brains don't like to spend time on nuance and grey areas. We all tend to quickly categorize things into good or bad, easy or hard, black or white.
[Questions] Does this time have to be a "waste" for you? With no productivity? That seems pretty extreme.
[Providing Suggestions] Thanks for saying that! I liked talking with you, and we can wrap this up. I guess i'm saying you sound thoughtful and intelligent, i'm confident that you could find ways to get more out of this time if that's what you're wanting to do.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Not as productive? Of course! It's a pandemic. We all are. :) Hope you're not too hard on yourself right now.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Ha, exactly. Maybe we're not all thriving and getting rich and adding 15 pounds of muscle during this time. But we can get through it.
[Questions] Before we quit, would you want to say one specific thing you know you can do today to help yourself out?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Nice! Good job with those things.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Right on, same to you. It's okay to feel anxious right now. It's okay to feel unproductive right now. It's also okay to keep on doing the things that make you feel okay. Great job keeping up the workouts and the classes.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Stay well and safe to you too! Take care.
[Questions] Hello. Hope you are doing fine.
[Questions] How was your day
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Can i help you with anything?
[Self-disclosure] I've been feeling blessed today
[Questions] Are you doing good today?
[Information] Ohhh. Any specific reason or incident?
[Reflection of feelings] I am really sorry to hear that.
[Information] Having many boyfriend is not a big deal
[Reflection of feelings] I believe that you are good
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Things tends to happens for the goodness
[Self-disclosure] Thanks for the compliments. People have worst time to bring up the bright times. I totally believe in it
[Information] Ohhh really. But women have a equal rights as men.
[Information] Women's are succeeding in all the fields now a days.
[Reflection of feelings] I am glad that, i could able to help u.
[Questions] What kind of difficulties are u facing?
[Questions] fight happens for?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] If you could tell me little bit specifically, i would be able to help u out.
[Questions] Ahhh. Are they distrubing u?
[Questions] Good. What bring you here today
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] So what i hear you saying is that since covid your friends won't talk to you and that they make fun of you for wanting to wear a mask and protect yourself?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry to hear that your friends have been so distant lately. Have you tried to ask them why they have been this way?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] So what i hear you saying is that they have backed away from you because you have chosen to take precautions due to covid and they are choosing to not? Is that correct?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Well you are being smart by doing the right thing and protecting yourself and others during this time. You should not feel bad about what you are doing.
[Questions] Do you have any other friends besides this group? Do you have other people that you could reach out to that are social distancing that you could relate to more during this time that you would have more in common with right now?
[Questions] What hobbies or activities do you like to do?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Field hockey that sounds like an exciting sport to play! That does sound like it would keep you busy
[Other] Have you thought about the possibility of meeting people online that share some of the same things that you like to do and that you could talk to ?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand that you feel that you would look desperate but you said you like reading book so there may be some online book clubs that you could join. I know that i have been involved in those and i didn't feel like i was seen as desperate since there are so many people that want to be social but don't want to put themselves at risk.
[Other] I am so glad i was able to help. Maybe we can try and set up another time to talk again?
[Other] Sounds great. You can let me know if you found a book club.
[Other] You are so very welcome. Merry christmas to you too!
[Other]  i look forward to talking to you soon!
[Reflection of feelings] I'm sorry to hear about that! I can totally understand why you'd be stressed.
[Questions] Is it for certain that you will lose your job?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I can feel your anxiety, and i completely understand why you're feeling that way, but you don't know for sure that will be true. Have you started looking for a new job already?
[Providing Suggestions] It definitely sounds like you're being overwhelmed with a lot of responsibilities along with your job loss. It's definitely a lot of things to deal with all at once, but it would help to break things down so they're more manageable. Do you have anyone close by who can help you out?
[Self-disclosure] I understand completely. I used to bottle things up too, but i've learned that the people who love you won't think you're a burden if you ask for help or just to have someone blow off some steam.
[Providing Suggestions] Changes are definitely scary, but they can also be a great opportunity to do something different. Is there anything you want to try doing?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you're very self-aware and i think your friends and family will be very willing to lend a hand.
[Other] Yes, your family, friends, and health are all really important! I hope you stay safe!
[Other] I hope you get to enjoy the coming holidays with your family and friends!
[Other] You're welcome! Have a great day.
[Self-disclosure] I hope i was able to help.
[Questions] Anything on your mind you'd like to release and discuss?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Go ahead. I am listening.
[Questions] What happened to lead to a fight with your friend?
[Self-disclosure] I fight with my best friend often, but that's okay because we don't have to always see eye-to-eye. We are always able to get through our arguments.
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] How does him not understanding you make you feel?
[Providing Suggestions] Maybe having a discussion with him about how him not responding to you makes you feel. Staying calm and clearly stating how you feel about how he treats you could make him understand how he is treating you and how to resolve your issues.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sure david loves you too. Some people don't pay much attention to the feelings of those around them. Having a discussion could be very helpful for both you and david.
[Questions] Do you think that is a course of action you would be willing to do?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] I think talking to david is a good idea. Can you explain why you want to say sorry to him?
[Providing Suggestions] If you feel as though you haven't done anything wrong and don't have a reason to apologize, i don't think you need to.
[Providing Suggestions] I would ask david to sit down together and tell him how you are honestly feeling. If he is a true friend, he will listen. He should want to make you feel better.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I think you should start with that, and see where it goes. Just know, that you are doing the best you can. You obviously care about david because you are reaching out for help for your friendship. You're off to a great start. I'm sure david would very much appreciate you caring so much about him.
[Other] It was great talking to you.
[Other] Have a great evening and good luck with david.
[Other] You are very welcome.
[Other] Of course.
[Other] It was a pleasure speaking with you as well.
[Other] We will talk another time.
[Other] Please end the conversation and will talk another time.
[Other] Goodbye.
[Other] Bye.
[Questions] I'm glad to hear that! How has work been going for you?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Absolutely, i think finding a job that you are passionate about is a goal for a majority of people.
[Questions] That's awesome, is there any aspect about your job that you don't like or enjoy as much?
[Self-disclosure] I can understand it, it sounds like you are in a position where you oversee others are in a teaching capacity. I too am in a similar position, and when people aren't as responsive to my ideas, it can definitely irritate me.
[Providing Suggestions] That makes sense, but it might be helpful to think about the other person's situation. Perhaps he/she hasn't had the same amount of training? Perhaps, they just need a little more guidance than other people who are more able to complete the tasks.
[Questions] What aspects do you especially have a hard time relating with?
[Providing Suggestions] That does sound exhausting, though some people might be reluctant to share their personal experiences, and it might be helpful to start smaller when getting to know someone and working up to more serious conversations.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I think it's great that it doesn't happen often and that you are able to recognize the few situations where it does begin to bother you.
[Providing Suggestions] That's even better! You are able to use your own skills to recognize the problems and take the appropriate steps forward. I think that if you are able to keep doing that, hopefully you'll find that people are a lot easier to relate to than you initially thought.
[Other] Pleasure chatting with you!
[Other] Also merry christmas!
[Other] I'm doing good!
[Questions] So how can help you? Is there anything bothering you today?
[Reflection of feelings] Oh i'm so sorry to hear that :(. That is terrible
[Providing Suggestions] Have you started looking for a new one?
[Providing Suggestions] I know this is difficult but the best thing i would recommend is moving on.
[Providing Suggestions] Do you have a linkdin account?
[Providing Suggestions] I would start by creating/updating that.
[Information] That way you can find newer jobs.
[Information] so linkedin gives quite a few suggested jobs given your profile.
[Information] So an updated profile will show you jobs that you can apply that fit your skillset.
[Providing Suggestions] I would go to the "jobs" section in the menu and see what jobs you like best.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Its a bit vague but really just start looking and you will find something that fits!
[Information] Thats a good starting point too! I believe linkedin can give suggestions on resumes format as well too.
[Other] Well it seems you have a good starting point. Is there anything else you want to talk about?
[Other] Have a good day!
[Questions] Im sorry to hear that. how can i help
[Self-disclosure] That is always tough especially during this time of year and been there myself.
[Questions] What type of rejection are you experiencing
[Questions] I hate to ask you this but are you male or female?
[Other] I ask it changes the perception on how i may help you because male and females deal with things differently.
[Other] I am going to ask you a few questions if ok i don't want to sound like i am prying.
[Questions] Ok do yo live in a rural or city, are you into male females or the like?
[Self-disclosure] I too live in a rural area understand the complexities of tying to find someone. So my next question where looking to find that special connection.
[Self-disclosure] I understand doing that i have tried it myself and trying to find that connection is few and far between. What sites have you tried using?
[Providing Suggestions] Well it would depend on if you were religious i would suggest church functions for example. I use my hobbies like pool and darts and cards and join groups that creates some common ground.
[Self-disclosure] I have and i usually take someone i trust with me and if it doesnt feel right i leave.
[Other] No problem glad i could help.
[Questions] Is there anything else i can help with?
[Other] Good evening
[Questions] How is it going this evening ?
[Self-disclosure] I am great. I love the outdoors it make you feel free and apart of something much larger than yourself.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Kool beans ! I love life/outoors just in that same way.
[Other] No, i can not see what you sent initially could you please resend it?.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Betrayal is a hard pill to swallow. I think you brave for sharing what you have been experiencing. Thank you.
[Self-disclosure] We all go through similar situations in all of our lives. Its not about going through those situations it about for me what did i learn and how will this make me better in the future.
[Providing Suggestions] Those situation sometimes shows us there was time in that friendship where we could have been over extending ourselves. Those are the times we should have been given more love and attention to our self. We learn how to love ourselves more we others don't reciprocate what we give them. I think it ultimately about being a better friend to you first.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Well we just have to be careful with over giving of ourselves. You are more valuable to yourself than you know. You are very welcome.
[Other] Hi! How are you today?
[Questions] Oh no, why are you feeling this way?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I can imagine, it's so tough right now for everyone. You aren'y alone. Are you in school or at home?
[Providing Suggestions] Are you able to connect with friends while on break even virtually? That always helps!
[Providing Suggestions] That's so great. It's so healthy to keep up human contact in these times. When i am feeling sad, i do a virtual happy hour with my friends.
[Questions] It is! Is there anything else bothering you?
[Information] Totally, i think we're all feeling that way. Thankfully the vaccine is really close to being ready. That is really positive news!!
[Questions] I think by mid next year, which would be great! What year are you in school??
[Affirmation and Reassurance] That's great. You'll hopefully get at least 2 more normal years to enjoy school. I hope that is reassuring.
[Other] Of course! It is my pleasure. I hope you enjoy the rest of your soph year!!
[Information] I am truly sorry you are feeling this way. Those feelings can be overwhelming. Have you tried talking to a professional about this?
[Providing Suggestions] There are many therapists out there that work on a sliding scale based on your income. Some even offer free sessions. I would look into that for your local area. It also does not seem like your boyfriend is taking the issue seriously.
[Self-disclosure] I will tell you from experience, ignoring the issue is not going to help.
[Self-disclosure] It lasts until you deal with it. I talked to someone to help me understand why an dhow i was feeling this way. Dont worry about putting obstacles for me heh im here to help you.
[Information] One good thing covid has done for us is create a surge of telemedicine. I know my therapist along with many others are doing it this way now. It may not be as great as being in person but it helps having that ear to listen to you.
[Providing Suggestions] I can relate to that, spend 8 hours cleaning the place up for my 10 year old to tear it all down in 10 minutes. Jobs are a whole other can of worms as well. May i suggest though that, even though big goals are great to strive for, you set a bunch of smaller goals to complete?
[Providing Suggestions] Yea just last year they were a baby in my eyes ha. Maybe just even something as apply to 2 new jobs this week. Clean the kitchen on monday. Simple things.
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] How about starting with just doing the dishes, or wiping down the counter?
[Information] Yes i think that would be a great first step. I would try a google search like "therapists (my area) Sliding scale"
[Information] As for feeling better its different for everyone. I think it even took a couple months to recognize myself as worthy. Once you start feeling better about yourself it kind of snowballs in a good way.
[Other] Great! I hope for the best for you!
[Questions] What has got you feelin g so down today? I am here to listen and support you today!
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] What i am hearing is that you seem to have hit an extremem low due to your loss of someone very important to you recently, is this correct?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] It looks to me like you are pretty dedicated to getting through this hard timeand being successful at such as you have taken a big step reaching out for support tonight to help pull you through this safely.
[Questions] Would you feel comfortable giving me a little more detail as far as you problem with self abuse? what does this look like for you?
[Self-disclosure] This is very troubling for me to hear! I used to be a cutter as well so i can relate to this 100%
[Providing Suggestions] As a safety precaution, i would like to give you the phone number for the local crisis center in your area so that if you ever feel like hurting yourself you can reach out to them for immidiate help in case of this emergency. would that be something that you were open to?
[Questions] What state and county do you live in?
[Other] Give me one moment while i search for this number for you. I will be right back with you.
[Providing Suggestions] Anytime! That is what i am here for, to help others in need in any way that i can. The number for the local crisis center is 719-465-8365. I would like to share a second number with you as well. Aspen point is a mental health treatment center that accepts people for non residentail treatment such as counseling . The number is 719-786-3856. They also take medicaid if that happens to be your insurance provider. I have heard lots of great things about aspen point. I hope you give them a call to help you safely through these hard times you are having.
[Questions] Hello, how are you at the moment? My name is jo
[Questions] I am not so bad. Is there anything you'd like to talk to me about today?
[Other] I am sorry to hear that. What precipitated that, had you been having problems for a while?
[Reflection of feelings] Ah, so you feel as though your mother could and should have helped and you were put into an impossible position you were not prepared for?
[Self-disclosure] I can sympathise with you having siblings with extreme mental health problems - i have been there too and i know how difficult it is.
[Questions] Mentally ill people can unfortunately sometimes be manipulative, though they do not mean it. Have you had any contact with her since?
[Providing Suggestions] That sounds very toxic. Is it possible to persuade her to seek medical help? I realise she might be reluctant to
[Other] Ah yes, it is a terrible time at the moment isn't it? I think a lot of people are not getting the medical help that they need because of the virus
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Please do not beat yourself up over this - it does sound as though you have done absolutely everything you could to help.
[Reflection of feelings] I can tell that you feel really bad about this just from your tone of voice. Please remember that you can't fix everything in the world.
[Information] Socialising can be hard for people with mental health problems. It might have been best if you did not press her too hard to do that though i know you did not realise.
[Questions] Does she suffer from depression also? That might account for her trying to shut herself away
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand that it can be very difficult to make people take medication if they refuse to recognise that they have a problem.
[Other] Unfortunately that is not likely to be possible. All you can do is be kind to yourself and know that you really did try to help her
[Other] I hope that i have been able to help a little. I really appreciate that you felt that you could open up to me
[Affirmation and Reassurance] You're welcome. Have a lovely festive season! I feel that all will be better in the coming year.
[Other] You need to press quit from your end and take the survey :)
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] You are having some trouble getting over something is that correct?
[Questions] Why are you feeling just alright?
[Reflection of feelings] I understand that it is hard to have some type of joy especially with the holidays coming along especially when family has passed on.
[Self-disclosure] I know it is hard, it also has taken a toll on me as well this pandemic is hard to go through, but i take it day by day. Maybe you should take to someone if there is anyone close to you?
[Providing Suggestions] maybe you should try to call her sometime im sure she would like that
[Providing Suggestions] right i see where you are coming from, remeber she is your family
[Affirmation and Reassurance] see you got this, a call is all that it takes to feel better

[Affirmation and Reassurance] Im glad that you are going to follow my suggestion, we all go through the same thing but your getting help and thats whats counts
[Information] exactly you got it, we all need to surround ourselves with good people, im glad that you realize this. I hope that my insight has given you motavation to pursue relationships

[Questions] How r u today
[Questions] What seems to be the issue
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Can you talk about what is going on
[Questions] Wow that is not a happy situation. How long ago
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] I can assume you had been together for awhile
[Questions] Had you been together for awhile
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] So he wanted you and made you feel special
[Questions] Was the other person someone you knew as well
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Seems like he was playing the field not just you but the other as well
[Questions] Did he have children with his x
[Reflection of feelings] I can understand your sadness
[Questions] Has he been contacting you lately
[Questions] was he your 1st love
[Other] How did you meet each other
[Other] He must still care because he is talking with you, but he is also involved with his x
[Questions] Has the covid interfered with you
[Other] There is another way to look at this
[Affirmation and Reassurance] You sound very attractive and other men would love you fro who u r
[Other] So it is safe to ay the chances of seeing each other is going to be impossible for a while
[Questions] Would it be safe for you to try and chat with someone online that would care for you
[Reflection of feelings] It may take a little time but watch your heart. it is very easy to break
[Reflection of feelings] Surround yourself with family and friends. You might be surprised the person you meet wil be right there waiting
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Love is a funny thing. U don't see the true love until you are in a spot of least accommodating
[Reflection of feelings] Step out and be patient. Don't allow feelings to control u but let your heart tell you it is real
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Hope this helped
[Providing Suggestions] Just be yourself.
[Other] Have a merry christmas
[Other] ok. Bye
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Sorry i'm here, please tell me you problems
[Questions] Why do you think that way?
[Reflection of feelings] Have you asked your friends regarding this?
[Providing Suggestions] Okay, maybe you should ask your friends, let them know how you feel and see what they say about it
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Under any circumstances, make sure you know you are not at wrong here.i hope it will not be the case but your friends might try victim blaming
[Providing Suggestions] So keep your stance and keep asking for the answer
[Questions] I'm pretty this has happened a few times already, hasn't it?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] so you have every right to be upset and confront them, you shouldn't feel like you're attacking. You are just asking for what you deserve
[Providing Suggestions] What you need to do is note down the occasions where they exclude you and ask exactly what happened then
[Providing Suggestions] Yes, that's good, ask them if you did something that offended them and why they excluded you. If they deny, then you can tell them how you feel. If they care about your friendship they will do something to fix
[Other] honestly, i think you also know that if you care about someone and they feel upset, you'll do everything you can to help the situation. Therefore, if your friends refuse to acknowledge your feelings, i don't think you should be friends either
[Questions] How are you?
[Questions] I am good, thanks. How may i help you?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, you are depressed because your partner left you, is that correct?
[Questions] How do you spend you times of a typical day other than working?
[Questions] Now, since she is not there, what do you do?
[Providing Suggestions] I suggest you engage with some of your hobbies to keep you mind busy.
[Other] Is there anything else i could help you with?
[Other] In that case please click "quit" end the conversation.
[Other] I'm doing fine, you can tell me your problems
[Questions] Oooh that's a very complicated situation. They are both adults, i hope even with tension, they don't do anything inappropriate, do they?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ah, those people are the hardest to deal with. If it's too much, have you and your wife considered moving away?
[Questions] I understand, you're in a very tough spot. Have your wife ever expressed her annoyance?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] That's not too bad then. Your wife seems to be mature and understanding. If you can't do anything to completely avoid your ex, maybe your best choice is to limit seeing her as much as possible
[Other] You and your wife can hang out a bit further from your home. It's inconvenient but at least your time won't be interrupted by your ex
[Other] I'm here
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Of course if you think you're good with my advice
[Questions] Sure, is there anything else i can help you with?
[Questions] Can you explain a little more what you mean by that?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like the trouble at home is making it hard for you to keep your mind on school. Is that right?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand why you would feel that way.
[Providing Suggestions] You also sais there is a bully. Have you talked to anyone about this?
[Providing Suggestions] Bringing this up to a teacher can help. Have you tried that?
[Reflection of feelings] I can tell just from this short chat how upset you are.
[Self-disclosure] I know when i was dealing with issues in school talking to my friends helped.
[Information] It sounds like those people are not your friends then.
[Questions] Do you have any hobbies?
[Providing Suggestions] It might be a good idea to join a choir. That way you can meet people who love to sing just like you!
[Providing Suggestions] Sometimes it helps to bring up your feelings to your parents. Have you tried that?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand why you feel like that. I think it's worth bringing up.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] It's understandable. Anyone would feel like that in your position. But i think you can do it and it will help!
[Providing Suggestions] Maybe before you talk to them, take some time to write down what you are feeling. You could even give them a letter to read if that makes you more comfortable.
[Other] That sounds like you have a plan!
[Other] You're welcome.
[Other] No problem.
[Other] Hello
[Questions] I am good, how are you?
[Questions] What seems to be bothering you tonight?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] So just to make sure i understand completely, you are ready to move on to the next step of your relationship and you don't feel as though your boyfriend is and this is making you anxious and upset,
[Self-disclosure] I completely understand that, as i was in a long term relationship and i felt as though my girlfriend at the time did not want to take things to the next step and i was not happy about it.
[Providing Suggestions] Have you had that conversation with him? I know it might be a difficult conversation to have, but it is often good to get expectations out in the open so you are on the same page with your partner .
[Self-disclosure] That is tough, but sometimes people just portray things differently, for instance i am also very laid back and nonchalant about most things which can lead to miscommunications.
[Providing Suggestions] I don't think it would be pushing if you haven't had that conversation in almost a year.
[Other] You need to know where he is so you can make a good decision for yourself!
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I know it is difficult, but i know you can get through it!
[Other] Good, i am happy for you!
[Other] I am glad i was able to help!
[Other] You're welcome! If you need any more help just chat back with us again.

[Other] have what
[Other] I am sorry to hear that but i am happy to listen and help you if i can
[Questions] what sort of things are you trying to decide?
[Providing Suggestions] Well, let's try to take it one problem at a time so's not to get overwhelmed. What is your biggest problem at the moment?
[Reflection of feelings] Ah, am i to take it that a relationship has recently ended?
[Self-disclosure] Ah i totally hear you .. the old 'we're getting divorced' line. I've been in that one! You are well out of this.
[Self-disclosure] From personal experience i think that if they say they're going to get divorced and then drag their feet it is never going to happen.
[Other] Well, if you were to give him an ultimatum what do you think he would say?
[Questions] And he's still married?
[Reflection of feelings] I can tell that you feel that you are being cheated here. I can't tell you what to do but don't you think you deserve better?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] It's not for me to say but i wonder if he's really going to change as he has not already.
[Questions] How do your children feel about this? And his?
[Questions] Yes, i can imagine that it is. It is always really difficult when children are involved. I know you would not want your children to be hurt
[Self-disclosure] I hear you. Covid has disrupted the whole world so might this year! I can't wait for it to be over.
[Other] But it will hurt them more the longer the situation goes on :(
[Other] Well it surely could not be worse :)
[Other] (sorry was afk let me catch up)
[Providing Suggestions] Is it possible she is suffering from depression?
[Other] It just worries me that he might treat you the same way if you were ever in the same position
[Questions] And how does she feel about you?
[Providing Suggestions] I think it would be better if he were able to come to a sensible financial solution with her. This situation is damaging for everyone.
[Other] I hope i have been able to have been of some help to you :) A very happy new year to you!
[Information] You just need to press quit and take the survey - it has to be done at your end :)
[Questions] hello how are you today?
[Questions] I'm doing well. Ok i can help. Whats going on?
[Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you are unsure of how to deal with favoritism in the workplace. I have dealt with similar situations.
[Questions] When did this start?
[Questions] Can you tell me some examples about the injustice?
[Self-disclosure] Is the logging out early a reward for their work? I had a job that offered similar rewards based on performance.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] That is very inappropriate. This must be very hard for you.
[Information] If your manager has a supervisor that you feel would not approve of this behavior, i would speak to them. If you don't feel that would be beneficial to you, you could reach out to your company hr department.
[Providing Suggestions] I would not be able to let this go either. I'm so sorry you're in such an unfair and unethical work environment. Do you know the supervisor well or interact with them? It could backfire if they both interact with this behavior. I believe you will make the right decision. If it does backfire, this is a toxic work environment and not a good fit for you.
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] You are very welcome. It does feel good to communicate with people who can understand how you feel. I wish you the very best of luck.
[Reflection of feelings] You're welcome. You be safe as well.
[Questions] I am well. Anything i can help with today?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand it has een stressful for you during lockdown unemployed, that must feel frustrating.
[Questions] Is there anyone in your imediate household you can confide in with your feelings?
[Self-disclosure] I compleyely understand i have also lost my career due to covid. Dont give up, staying positive and open minded to new opportunities will help you find work.
[Information]  i see.i would call the companies themselves and see if they have programs in place to help you.
[Information] At least they might give extensions.
[Other] Also there are people willing to help sometimes in local places. An extension would happen when the institution you owe gives you more time to pay them.
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] I would try going to the town hall.
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Going to the town hall means phsyically going to your local town hall asking for help for assistance. There should within have programs you can apply for.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Once again i a, sorry to hear that you are depressed. Make sure to go ouside everyday. I have learned that healthy doses of sunshine help. Yes i have often felt helpless due this pandemic.
[Reflection of feelings] I will say though that exercise, movies and lots of coffee have helped me.
[Self-disclosure] Yes i normally use netflix.
[Self-disclosure] prime i do no use so much
[Questions] Did this conversation make you feel any less depressed?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] No i can usuallly find something new to watch.

[Questions] Yes i am real and doing this task for amazon mechanical turk, are you as well?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Although i do genuinelly care for helping others feel ettter.

[Restatement or Paraphrasing] well i will end and say goodye i hope you get through this. i know you will
[Questions] I'm doing well. How are you?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sorry to hear that, what's going on?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] I see. I assume you are taking it seriously?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh wow, i'm very sorry to hear that! I'm sorry for your loss.
[Questions] Do your friends know that you were sick or that you lost a loved one?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] So they are not taking you seriously either then?
[Reflection of feelings] That's really frustrating and i'm sorry to hear that.
[Providing Suggestions] Do you have any friends who you can trust and talk to?
[Providing Suggestions] That can certainly be difficult to talk about. But maybe you can build stronger relationships with them.
[Information] Friendships can change overtime and sometimes people who don't value the friendship can find themselves without friends.
[Providing Suggestions] Maybe you don't have to say goodbye. Maybe you can just ignore them and see if any of them reach out to you.
[Providing Suggestions] You shouldn't have to feel bad in a friendship. Friends are supposed to support each other. If you aren't feeling support, maybe it's time to make new friends.
[Self-disclosure] I think that's a great plan!
[Other] No problem! glad i could help!
[Other] Not too bad! It looks like a lovely day out.
[Other] Well make sure you're bundled up and warm!
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Sounds cozy. Glad to hear that you're staying safe indoors!
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Definitely! How are you dealing with the pandemic? It's been a long year.
[Self-disclosure] I'm not too bad, but cases are also going up here in california. Luckily, my family and i haven't gotten sick.
[Information] I think that's true for a lot of states since cases seem to be going up everywhere, unfortunately. What are your plans for the holidays?
[Self-disclosure] We're planning on camping in the desert. That's a good idea to save money. How do you plan on saving money?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Those are all really good ideas, and it sounds like you know what's really important! It's definitely been a tough year, but it's also good to look ahead and plan for the future.
[Other] It's been great chatting with you too! Hope you and your loved ones stay safe out there!
[Questions] Hello to you!
[Questions] What brings you to chat today?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Sounds like it is tough to get going in the morning because you have feelings of loneliness?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I hear you. How long have you been doing mturk?
[Providing Suggestions] Do you think it may help to talk to a therapist or even a job counselor?
[Providing Suggestions] There are many therapists who use different techniques and methods. Maybe talking to another would help.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] That sounds tough. I am sorry to hear that.
[Other] Life can be rough, believe me, i know. Just don't give. Keep reaching out until you find a good fit. You are brave for taking care of yourself despite the things going on!
[Providing Suggestions] I know there are agencies that help with such matters. Do not give up.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] That sounds more like their problem than yours. You deserve supportive people in your life. Keep reaching out.
[Information] That sounds painful. There are groups out there where you can share common experiences there is help. You took a good first step by reaching out tonight.
[Providing Suggestions] I have been there. Maybe seeing a job counselor would help. They might help find a job that fulfills you.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I hope you take care of yourself. This life can be tough. But the fact that you are reaching out is good.
[Other] hello! it's nice to meet you
[Questions] What would you like to talk about today?
[Questions] What is making you feel ashamed?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] it seems that you feel ashamed because you are feeling messy? is this correct?
[Questions] When did this begin?
[Other] What do you feel like brought you into this situation?
[Other] what kind of recession?
[Other] No there will be no recession i believe in due time everything will get much better pretty soon
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I know with the pandemic going on everyone is so worried about everything but you should not worry everything will get better soon
[Reflection of feelings] I can understand how you are feeling because sometimes i be thinking the same thing
[Reflection of feelings] many people have lost their job and many businesses are losing money and going out of business and i know it is really hard right now
[Other] all i can do is just pray everything gets better we are not going to go through this forever there will be better days
[Providing Suggestions] Yes i honestly believe it can recover if we all come together and help our economy
[Self-disclosure] do not let what is going on lead to depression because then it will make it worse on you just know it will be okay
[Other] We all got to want to make the economy a better economy and want to come together and help
[Other] No i believe it is far from becoming ww2
[Providing Suggestions] no just by coming up with a plan
[Other] What plan do you have in mind?
[Providing Suggestions] I would be saving money not spending to much of it
[Other] What do you think should happen?
[Reflection of feelings] i just know one thing i believe there will be no recession and everything is going to get better in time
[Affirmation and Reassurance] This pandemic is not going to last forever and since there is now a vaccine for it then everything should start to get better soon
[Providing Suggestions] Just pray to god about the situation and just know it is all going to be okay
[Other] you do the same have a good day
[Other] Hello, how are you?
[Other] could you tell me more about that?
[Questions] I'm very sorry to hear that. Do you know where you are moving?
[Information] That is a difficult situation. Have you been working with a realtor?
[Providing Suggestions] Yes, your realtor should be more helpful than that. My best advice is to stay calm. You are making the correct decisions so far. It is difficult, but you are managing it very well.
[Providing Suggestions] Sometimes life will throw challenges toward you, and all you can do is make the right choices, one at a time. Sounds like you are making the right choices to get back on your feet. I'm sure you will be there in no time.
[Providing Suggestions] Are you taking the right steps to stay healthy? Wearing a mask, avoiding large gatherings, and social distancing?
[Other] Good point. Since you hired them, you can establish expectations with them that they take the right precautions to keep you and your home healthy.
[Questions] Tell me about your job search. Also, what experience do you have?
[Questions] Does csr stand for customer service representative?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, csr and experience in banking must mean you have some skills that are in high-demand. Many companies need csr's, and banks are always hiring. Skills needed for csr are very translatable to other customer service jobs, sales, and more!
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sure you will find something very quickly.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] also, many companies have shifted their workforce to work from home, so you are even more likely to get a service position in a work-from-home environment,
[Providing Suggestions] I see, so it sounds like you need a job search tool that will save you time. I'd recommend putting your profile on linkedin, and/or checking a job aggregator like indeed or glassdoor. There, you can view and apply for several jobs. I recommend applying and interviewing for several positions at the same time to improve your odds. I'm sure you will get one.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Glad to hear. Sounds like your are doing all the right things.
[Other] hello!!
[Questions] how is your day?
[Questions] what is the reason for depression are you feeling bored or some other reasons?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] no problem, i am also facing the same problem of being bored during the lockdown
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] the only thing which could entertain us is gadgets. I used to watch many web series and online shows in my mobile
[Providing Suggestions] be cautious in your health as you say that you need to recover from the cold take foods which keeps you warm and some natural medicines
[Other] yes i draw but not so good in drawing
[Questions] do you have kids in your house?
[Self-disclosure] that's great i too love star wars
[Affirmation and Reassurance] yeah there is a kid in my house who is my entertainer in lockdown
[Reflection of feelings] avengers end game
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] you are right
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] yeah that's the safest way too
[Affirmation and Reassurance] spending time with friends is like creating more funny memories
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] yeah i love grow herbs in my house this is one of my favourite hobby
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] you are welcome and thanks to spend this time
[Other] have a wonderful and cheering day!!
[Reflection of feelings] That seems like a tough situation! What feelings made you decide you need to breakup with her?
[Self-disclosure] I completely understand that. I recently broke up with my boyfriend earlier this year, because i didn't feel like i loved him as much as i used to. Things like that are important!
[Questions] How long have you guys been together?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Oh i see. That's a huge step to make in a relationship. So you are hesitant to break up with her because she moved just to be with you?
[Questions] Have you communicated with her about your concerns? Such as being difficult to live with?
[Self-disclosure] I think it's great that we got matched up, because i went through also the exact same situation. My boyfriend and i were long distance, and he moved across the country to be closer to me. So when i felt like we needed to break up, i was experiencing similar guilt that you are experiencing.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I want to reassure you, that doing what's best for you is what is most important! Your partner will understand this if they truly care for you. Things will be tough for a while, but you both will be able to grow from this experience. And just because you don't want to be in a relationship anymore, doesn't mean that you don't care about her!
[Providing Suggestions] Staying friends after the fact might take the pressure off of you a little bit. You can still help her out and be there for each other, but as friends instead of partner's.
[Reflection of feelings] Yes exactly! It's so difficult for the dumper as well, because of course you still have strong feelings for this person. They just aren't romantic anymore.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] And that is okay. You don't need to feel guilty for things that you can't control. You can still be there for her without pretending to be in love
[Providing Suggestions] I think talking to her and being transparent about your feelings is definitely the right move. In doing this, reassure her you still want to be friends and you aren't just "kicking her to the curb." things will obviously be awkward for the first little bit, because continuing to live together will bring it's own difficulties. But the beautiful thing about that is, you guys are already used to it. :) So it's only hard if you make it hard
[Reflection of feelings] Yes exactly. And from chatting with you, i can tell that you are a very caring person. You don't want to hurt her. I believe that you have the understanding of the situation, and you know what you should and shouldn't do in order to make it work. The hard part is simply getting the courage to finally discuss it. But i think you are going to be able to do that just fine!
[Reflection of feelings] What i've gathered about you as a person, makes me confident that you probably chose a partner that will be able to have this talk with you and you both will come to an understanding.
[Other] Yes i think it's very great we were able to connect on our issues! It definitely helps. You are welcome! :)
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Of course! And it wouldn't be fair to her, just as much as it wouldn't be fair to you. Your happiness is just as important!
[Other] Of course! I'm glad that you are feeling a bit better about everything! You as well!
[Self-disclosure] i'm glad to hear that! Mine is going ok, made a space for the christmas tree in the living room
[Questions] so how have things been going for you?
[Self-disclosure] that's good! things are as ok as they can be. waiting on covid test results for my youngest son fingers crossed
[Questions] was there something you wanted to talk about in particular?
[Self-disclosure] thanks! i apprecitae that very much. we believe he's outside the exposure window just wanted to be sure. what have you been up to during the pandemic?
[Questions] not really, i just assume everyone is covid stressed and tired. what have you been doing that has helped you cope with it all?
[Self-disclosure] good for you! we were in the city mid february for a quick trip. got in 2 trips to veselka in the village!
[Self-disclosure] has it been weird to be in the city without the normal activity? I was there one year for a huge snowstorm and it freaked me out to see and hear times square being silent
[Questions] it's weird everywhere. what's been your biggest challenge?
[Self-disclosure] That's a big one! that would be my top one too. I miss seeing the people outside of my house - parents, friends
[Providing Suggestions] they will. the spanish flu pandemic was followed by the roaring 1920's
[Information] i've been frustrated with the people who aren't following the rules, i don't understand the point of arguing against masks
[Information] if it works, why aren't we doing it?
[Reflection of feelings] Ugh. I am sorry to hear that. That must be frustrating.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] You reaching out here shows me that you are solution-driven so i feel strongly that we can work through this!
[Self-disclosure] I have definitely had work situations where my higher ups have over stepped their boundaries to the point of being intrusive.
[Providing Suggestions] One thing that worked well for me was speaking to members of the board.
[Providing Suggestions] Another thing that i found helpful was speaking with my friends and family about it.
[Information] As it pertains to the board, i found that the other member was very receptive to the conversation. Inevitably, they wanted to do what was right for the employees.
[Reflection of feelings] The power dynamics make it more challenging to be as open as we would like to be, right?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Yes. There are certainly times when finding a new position is the right thing to do. It sounds like you not feeling supported in the work place is grounds for a new position. Is that accurate?
[Reflection of feelings] I am hearing your frustration through all of this while also hearing your dedication to the work.
[Other] You are more than welcome.
[Providing Suggestions] Is there anything else that i may be able to further support you with today?
[Other] You are welcome! And have a great day!
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] I'm sorry to hear you lost your job and have worries about paying the bills.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] That is hard having so much pressure but i think you will be able to soon get employed again.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you are trying really hard and that is worthy of praise.
[Providing Suggestions] Sometimes deep breaths help people calm down. Have you tried that at all?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] That can sometimes help you to regain your focus and be able to do more for yourself.
[Questions] Also, job counselors may help at employment agencies to match you with potential employers. Have you tried any?
[Self-disclosure] I sought out help from a recruiter online who helped me to find a job as well. Have you heard of that option or tried it?
[Reflection of feelings] Yes, i see that you seemed to be more relieved finding out these options. Would you say these suggestions have been helpful?
[Information] From what i've seen, people who can use some of these strategies like deep breathing and counseling they have felt some relief and could move forward better toward their goals.
[Other] You are welcome. Can i help you with anything else?
[Questions] Im okay how are you?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Oh no, that's not good. I understand how you feel there. I can definately relate to that...what's going on?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you applied for the security team and was denied because of your full time position with the same company?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Wow, that is crazy that is going on, it doesn't seem fair at all...
[Questions] Have you tried going to any higher up? Perhaps in the hr department?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] That's horrible they would treat the hospital workers like this, with everything that is going on in the world today.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] That is a position right there in the line of fire.
[Self-disclosure] Have you tried for employment anywhere else? I wouldn't just quit and not have something else at least working in the background.
[Providing Suggestions] I definitely understand that. Do you want a couple links on dealing with some stress? I personally like to run..
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] I live in georgia so yes i so run every morning...great stress reliever
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Wow that is cold..
[Providing Suggestions] I could not run in that what so ever... Do you have a gym?
[Other] how are you doing this morning
[Questions] sorry to hear that, why are you soo down?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] if i heard you correctly, your fiancÃ©e which her family is going through a lot couldn't get married to you because of border restriction?
[Reflection of feelings] i can see why you are soo depressed, i am soo sorry for what both you and your fiancÃ©e is going through
[Questions] if i may ask, where is your fiancÃ©e from?
[Self-disclosure] i have had of such scenario before, so what step have u taken to remedy the situation
[Providing Suggestions] if you are an american, you can just go to indonesia, get married to your beautiful fiancÃ©e and come back as a couple
[Information] ok. what about this: go to a country like greece that allows american, tell your fiancÃ©e to meet you there. get married over there and spend your honeymoon there too
[Providing Suggestions] and if greece didn't permit indonesian, then you just go to greece, wait there for two weeks and then leave for indonesia.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i know you need to be with your fiancee during this hard time especially with what is going on with her family. But remember that you have to be strong for her.
[Other] you're welcome
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] and do have a good day you self and stay safe
[Other] Hi! How are you today?
[Questions] It sounds like you might be upset. Can you tell me whatâ€™s going on?
[Reflection of feelings] That sounds difficult and stressful. What do you do when you see it happening?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you are avoiding things you enjoy because of their actions. I think documenting it is a good idea! Have you tried reporting them for harassing you?
[Questions] That must be very frustrating. Can you tell me if youâ€™ve tried other things to get them to stop?
[Self-disclosure] You tried to do the right thing and they are having a difficult time letting go. The ongoing comments through social media sounds like they are wanting your attention. That can be exhausting for you. In my past, i had to block someone who did something similar to me. If my friends mentioned seeing something from my ex about me, i asked them to keep it to themselves or consider blocking them,too. The people who were closest to me understood what was going on and i realized that people who didnâ€™t know me, didnâ€™t matter. Would you be willing to suggest this to friends or family if it would help to remove the ex from your interactions?
[Questions] I see. How long has this been going on and is this a daily occurrence or does it happen at certain times?
[Providing Suggestions] I can sense your frustration. It must be overwhelming at times and make you dread the weekends. It sounds like it has become a habit for your ex. It might help if you write a letter to them explaining that you are ready to move on and are asking them to do the same. Explain that you are giving them the opportunity to stop harassing you in the following ways [list some of the details you have documented]. Inform them that if they do not stop, you are considering taking it further regarding harassing communications and that this letter serves as your intention to no longer tolerate their actions. Send it via certified mail and keep a copy. This will give them no way to immediately respond and would be the first step of official documentation should they decide to continue. Do you think that might help?
[Other] I sincerely hope it is a step toward you regaining your control over how you are able to interact with people. I wish you the best in dealing with this and hope you begin to feel better about it soon, especially entering into a new year!
[Questions] What seems to be going on in your marriage?
[Reflection of feelings] I can understand how you are feeling marriage is hard for some.
[Other] Communication is key in a marriage
[Affirmation and Reassurance] do not let this get the best of you. there are ups and downs in marriage but you have to be able to work through all that with your partner.
[Other] no i am not married but one day i do want to get married
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I know you will two will be able to work through this together
[Reflection of feelings] I am sorry to hear and i understand how you are feeling my parents recently got a divorce
[Self-disclosure] i can understand but you know you just have to move on with life and not let that get in the way especially your marriage
[Providing Suggestions] both of you need to try to sit down and have a talk about the marriage and let your partner know how you are feeling and see how your partner is feeling.
[Information] without communication then it will be hard to get through a marriage
[Information] when there is no communication then that is when the trouble starts and the marriage starts failing
[Providing Suggestions] find the right time to talk to your partner and just explain to your feelings towards what is going on and let your partner know you do not like what is going on
[Providing Suggestions] if that does not help try to seek help from a marriage counselor i have heard they have saved many marriages from failing
[Other] Your welcome
[Questions] Hello, how are you doing?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Those can be really hard feelings to deal with, but reaching out and acknowledging them is a very positive step. Is their anything in particular making you feel anxious?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Drastic changes in our life plans can feel very upsetting and looking for a job in these times is ridiculous.
[Questions] What made you feel the need to drop out of graduate school?
[Reflection of feelings] I understand that and that was a really brave choice to make before you cornered yourself into a degree that wouldn't benefit your future paths.
[Providing Suggestions] Have you gone and smoke to your local job centers? They can often times find suitable jobs or even creative suggestions that can utilize your skills and even grown them.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Refusing to finish something that does not benefit your end goal isn't quitting its merely switching strategies to your personal end goal
[Providing Suggestions] I am from north carolina and in every city there are job centers, you can look them up by that title, they have people there who can help you find work based on your personality and skills. as well helping with resumes, interveiws, computers, all kinds of things.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Im sorry you feel that way but education is never a wasted effort it can only make you level up even if you choose not to actively use what you acquire. Its always nice to have a big back up arsenal so you have options when something you want does turn up.
[Information] Im really glad that suggestion might be helpful for you.
[Other] Have you checked to see if any of the credits you have earned already are transferable to another degree you may find of interest?
[Other] oh man that sucks, i am sorry. Thirty really is not old in our current time. shoot alot of people dont event start school till that age for whatever reason or the other.
[Other] Hahaha lol thank you so much. I enjoyed talking to you and really do wish you the best of luck.
[Information] I appreciate your patience with my spelling and grammar. bye bye
[Questions] I am doing well, thanks for asking! How are you?
[Questions] I'm sorry to hear that. Can you describe what's going on?
[Other] What is your career, if you don't mind me asking?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] That sounds like a very difficult major to study. That's a very notable goal!
[Self-disclosure] I have had a similar experience. I am studying to become a certified optician at the moment.
[Questions] Is there anything in particular that is making you feel this way towards your goal?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you're worried a lot about your career's future, if that sounds correct?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I think that's a completely normal feeling. It shows that you really care about your future and where you're going.
[Questions] It is! How long have you been studying civil engineering?
[Questions] Hey. How can i help?
[Questions] Okay. Well lets start with exactly what the problem is. What kind of tips do you need?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Okay i understand. Tell me a little about that.
[Questions] That is unfortunate. How did you accumulate such debt?
[Self-disclosure] That's tough. It has personally affect me as well as my financial health as well. I know the frustration.
[Questions] Well to do so i need a little more information. Have you already taken any steps to help your situation?
[Questions] If so what steps have you taken?
[Other] Okay that is an excellent start. Now to avoid another debt later on. Do you have a job to work with the payments to pay back the loan?
[Providing Suggestions] If i may offer a suggestion. Have you thought of contacting a debt relief program? In some cases they can substantially reduce debt to something much more manageable.
[Questions] Do you mind me asking what it is that caused you to reach out to someone for support?
[Other] I'm not aware of there being a phone number for you to call. This is a task that is supposed to be done via amazon's mechanical turk platform. I believe you're supposed to tell me what the problem is. Then, i will help you through it as best as i can.
[Other] That sounds good!
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm so sorry to hear that. Take your time!
[Reflection of feelings] Oh my goodness. I am so incredibly sorry that all of this happened to you. I can tell that you are completely overwhelmed with emotions right now.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I don't believe that you did anything wrong whatsoever. Sometimes, really unfair things happen to really good people. I can't even imagine how hard this must be, but i would try to look at it in a positive way. I know that losing your best friend and your fiancÃ© must be devastating, but at least you now know that your fiancÃ© is someone who you most certainly probably don't want to spend the rest of your life with.
[Self-disclosure] I've been cheated on myself, believe it or not, and it was my daughter's father and my best friend. I can't believe how similar our stories are. I'm not even kidding! I refused to get back together with him (we were engaged at one time as well) and because i refused to get back together with him, he got my best friend pregnant and they are now together and recently had a second child. He has completely forgotten that our daughter exists.
[Providing Suggestions] I think i would start by putting your own health first and getting yourself tested to make sure that you haven't contracted anything from your fiancÃ©. I know this will be incredibly hard, but i wouldn't want to see you getting sick and suffering as a result of his infidelity.
[Self-disclosure] No, we were not married. We were together for almost 7 years and engaged at one point, but i broke it off after he cheated on me. He cheated on me several times. It's the worst feeling in the world.
[Information] I would be scared, too. However, it's better to act now because to my knowledge, the sooner that you find out and treat it, the better the chances are of you treating it. There are a lot of new medications out there that can be used to treat hiv and aids.
[Self-disclosure] I know that their first child is a girl. I'm not sure if their second is a girl or a boy. I haven't spoken to him in several years. I found out through a friend about their second child. We haven't spoken at all since i found out about the first one.
[Self-disclosure] I have been tested for all stds because i was cheated on. All of mine came back negative. All they did when i got tested was bloodwork.
[Providing Suggestions] Have you thought about reaching out to a therapist or counselor who could help you to work through your feelings and everything that you're dealing with?
[Other] I am so incredibly sorry that you have to deal with all of this at all but especially at the start of the holiday season. My heart absolutely breaks for you.
[Self-disclosure] Yes, we have a daughter. He spent the first eight years of her life in prison. I gave her the choice as to whether or not she wanted to get to know him. He had plenty of opportunities to speak to her and chose not to call or show up when he was supposed to. The last thing she said about him was, "all he does is lie to me and break promises. I don't want to see him or talk to him anymore."
[Self-disclosure] I'm a great mother and i always put my daughter's feelings first. She made the decision not to see or speak to her father. Him and my now ex-best friend are on drugs and don't have custody of their own children. It's in my daughter's best interest that she doesn't know him.
[Self-disclosure] Yes, we are both in therapy. It helps immensely.
[Providing Suggestions] I know that you weren't the one who cheated, but i would still highly recommend talking to someone about what happened. This is going to be very hard to get through. Again, i am incredibly sorry that you are going through all of this. Our chat session will only last for a total of about 30 minutes. This is meant to be a one-time task, unfortunately.
[Self-disclosure] I never did drugs either. My daughter's father did.
[Other] He still does, and so does my best friend. They lost custody of their kids. I have custody of my daughter.
[Other] Anyway, i hope that you eventually become more open to talking to a therapist on an ongoing basis. I hope you have a happy thanksgiving.
[Other] Oh, wow. I didn't know that you were pregnant. I hope that you and your baby are okay!
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I think you will be a great parent anyway! Best of luck to you.
[Questions] Hi! How are you today?
[Information] Finals can be so stressful. Have you been studying?
[Self-disclosure] I can imagine. When i was in school , i had the same thing happen to me. I was so sterssed, it led to me nto being able to focus.
[Self-disclosure] What really helped me was practicing mindfulness.
[Questions] Are there any exercies that you like doing?
[Questions] Have you made time to do that latey?
[Providing Suggestions] Definitely, exercise is a really good way to de-stress. It releases endorphins which can calm you and make you happy. This is a great way to reset before studying.
[Providing Suggestions] Have you tried setting small study goals? That always helps me. I set a hour for one small topic at a time , it makes studying less overwhelming.
[Providing Suggestions] Not necessarily studying less but break the 6 finals into smaller tasks. Use index cards to organize yourself. I alwyas start with an outline of topics i need to cover then put them onto index cards.
[Questions] That's up to you. Will your employer be accommodating about taking a day or two off? You want to make sure to not lose your job.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Definitely, worth a try.
[Other] Happy to help!! have a great day.
[Questions] Im sorry to hear that, would you like to go into whats causing you to feel this way?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Was this unexpected? As in, was there unwarranted withdrawals to your bank account?
[Providing Suggestions] Have you contacted your bank yet to see whats going on?
[Information] I would get on top of that as soon as possible. They are usually very accommodating with things like that. Ive had false charges that returned quickly. Hopefully that can get you to dallas soon
[Questions] Whats going on with your boyfriend though?
[Reflection of feelings] Im sorry i was confused before, so you are feeling as if you are abandoning him?
[Reflection of feelings] He will leave you if you do not come and help? That does not seem very healthy. Cant he see you are doing everything you can to try to get to him now?
[Providing Suggestions] Oh i hear you, i am sorry that you have been affected like that. Have you conveyed those feelings to him?
[Self-disclosure] Or have you spoken to a professional? I have had a very abusive relationship in the past. I couldnt get close to others until i spoke to my therapist. It was a long journey but i feel i am myself now though.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Thats great, that one small step can really make a big difference. Everyones path is different but i hope it really helps you.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I thank you for that, but we are here for you now, heh. They can be, it really helps to lay all the pieces on the table and try to put everything back where it goes. Sometimes you just have to break it all down to build it back up.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Yea, you do come out stronger in the end though. Its a good fight to get into. You seem to be talking the steps you need to, which is very good, not many people can or are willing too.
[Other] Well, i think its most people are afraid of what they have become but are more afraid of the hard work needed to get through. Its not easy.
[Self-disclosure] No its like living the nightmare all over again, except this time you know what happens. The one light at the end of the tunnel, at least for me, is knowing that alive right now to even think about it. It kinda helps in a weird way.
[Other] Yup, gotta take the small wins, let them build up. I hope us talking has been a small win.
[Questions] Hey, hi are you doing today?
[Questions] I'm pretty good, i can't complain. Is there any thing going on with your life that you would like to discuss?
[Reflection of feelings] I know separation isn't easy, especially with children involved. How are you coping with this transition?
[Questions] Well breakup is not easy so what you're feeling is normal. Have you ever sought out professional help for depression?
[Providing Suggestions] Are there hobbies or activities that you do that help you cope with issues such as jogging, reading, etc.?
[Information] Its good to see that you have activities you participate in that helps you cope. I also play video games to just get away mentally too. But yes, even hobbies are not the cure for issue but rather helps with the symptoms.
[Self-disclosure] I love to play shooters and sports lol. I will be getting into the vr world very soon.
[Self-disclosure] I'm scared as well as it may feel too realistic for me.
[Questions] hahaha...have you tslked to family and friends about the situation? How did they respond and what suggestions did they offer?
[Questions] Do you want the relationship to be over or you are truly done and want to move on?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] Although it's tough for the children, it's positive to hear that maybe it was for the best. The family seemed to echo your same feelings so it could be for the best.
[Providing Suggestions] Some children may act out if they have trouble expressing how they feel. I would suggest having regular talks with them and being transparent.
[Information] Oh wow, well its good that an explanation was there for him to understand. As time goes on, it will become easier
[Other] No problem, the pleasure was all mines!
[Other] You too, thanks!
[Other] Helo, how are you?
[Questions] Are you feeling sort of depressed? I am sorry
[Reflection of feelings] Would you feel happy if you think about after covid, maybe next year?
[Questions] have you been sleeping enough?
[Questions] Do you like morning or night?
[Self-disclosure] Me too. I like morning too. Air feels fresh, although it is little contaminated here. At night time, i feel a little bit anxiety more.
[Questions] So i sleep really early. Sleeping feels good anyway? Do you feel ok while you're sleeping?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I suggest listening to sad yet beautiful music. It sometimes helps me. Do you like classical music?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] When you are sad, listening to upbeat music may disturb you. Listening to instrumental music maybe good for you.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] I just checked youtube and searched for some music. Good, i hope it will soothe your mind.
[Other] Hello
[Questions] How can i help you tonight>
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] So just so i understand, your sports club struggled today so you are frustrated by this.
[Reflection of feelings] I can tell how frustrated this has made you just from exchanging these few messages.
[Self-disclosure] I completely understand the frustration, i am also a big sports fan and i get very frustrated when my team struggles.
[Providing Suggestions] Have you thought about talking to other fans of the team to get their feelings on the subject? Sometimes it helps to vent to people who feel the same frustration as you,
[Other] I understand completley.
[Questions] Do you have any other sports teams you are a fan of?
[Providing Suggestions] What other hobbies do you have? Sometimes it helps to distract from a tough loss to engage in other hobbies to take your mind off of it.
[Providing Suggestions] I would definitely go listen to some music and get your mind off of things.
[Other] I think that would help!
[Other] No problem! If you ever need anything else don't hesitate to reach out!
[Other] Have a good night!
