  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand your feelings. The holidays are a joyous time. No place for uncertainty.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Do you think that outlining a plan of action, and sharing that with your family will help turn this around a bit? Perhaps, think about as looking forward to a better opportunity in your future?",

  "[Reflection of feelings] I understand your frustration, it's upsetting when they dismiss what you say even though you have been friends for so long.",
  "[Other] What i would recommend in this case is, spend more time with other friends who appreciate you. You also need to tell rick your honest thought, don't beat around the bush but let him know you're serious",
  "[Self-disclosure] I have been in the same situation myself, what i usually do is sit down with them and start the conversation in a serious mood. Explain everything i need to say and tell them that i mean every word. If they don't seem to accept and change, i keep my distance from them",
  "[Other] That's even easier to make it clear, if you run into him, just give him a polite greetings. The point is, make it clear you have had enough",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes. Be not too harsh at first. I would say to give him 1 more chance. If he still doesn't respect your words, it's the best for both to say it clearly.",
  "[Other] You have the right mindset! Practice before talking will help you deliver your thoughts better.",
  "[Other] I would start with something along the line \"look, i know we have had this conversation many times. However, i feel as though you never take me seriously. I want to say this one last time....\"",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Getting emotional is totally fine, that's why you need practice",

  "[Questions] I am sorry to hear that. Would you like to tell me what the problem is?",
  "[Self-disclosure] I can understand how that feels - i have not been able to go out for weeks either. Are you able to have visitors?",
  "[Other] That is very rough. Have you considered joining internet communities so you can at least talk with people who are in the same situation?",
  "[Other] I think it really could, yes. Isolation is a very difficult thing to deal with. Just knowing someone else understood could really help.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] There is absolutely no problem with feeling bad and confiding in people. Many people are feeling the same right now.",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you feel as though life is just passing you by and you are not accomplishing anything during the lockdown?",

  "[Questions] How can i help?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm so sorry to hear that.",
  "[Questions] How long were you together?",
  "[Questions] That's tough. Can you describe what events led to the breakup?",
  "[Information] How do you think you will get through this? Do you have someone to talk with?",
  "[Providing Suggestions] It absolutely will take time. You are right. Can i suggest that you try to look at what went wrong before getting involved with someone else? Would it be possible to talk with your friends and family about what they think might have happened?",
  "[Reflection of feelings] I'm sure it will help to be with people who love you when you feeling so devastated.",
  "[Information] I hear you. All messages this time of year are about being with people we love and that will hit you hard at this time of year. Do you have any particular things you like to do to take care of yourself?",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Yes. when you are depressed it is hard to become motivated to do anything. However, it is extremely important that you do act. Keep moving through your days, even if you feel like you are in a haze. It may take awhile to build up to snowboarding. Maybe start with a daily walk and build from there. Action (physically doing something) triggers psychological movement. It will help you move through the pain that you are feeling.",

  "[Questions] that's a hard way to find out. are you still in the same house?",
  "[Reflection of feelings] i can't imagine what you are going through, but separate spaces sounds like a very good idea to me.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] before you take any action, i'd ask myself what are your options?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] you know that his actions have very little to do with you and more to do with him, right?",
  "[Questions] are your parents supportive of that idea?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] it's not about her or you. it's about him.",
  "[Information] they will understand. opening up to them will be the hardest part. it's a shame cocktail, but it's not one you made",
  "[Information] it's in our nature as women to ask \"what did i do?\" but it is never about us or anything we did.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] trust and vunerability is huge in a relationship. i'd look for professional help if you wan tot try and work on it",
  "[Providing Suggestions] do you have a friend who has been through a similar situation? sometime that helps. also, sharing your burden with someone does not add to their burden",
  "[Information] my guess is he felt the same way you are feeling right now",
  "[Providing Suggestions] watch the brene brown video on youtube with the cartoon animal about empathy - it should help when looking for friends to rely upon",
  "[Self-disclosure] grrrr. that would make me angry too",
  "[Information] i'm totally into the podcasts \"a slob comes clean\" basically it's about getting your poop in a group",
  "[Providing Suggestions] that's so hard. imagine how much energy he had to use to keep his lives from colliding. he couldn't find a better use for that energy?!",
  "[Self-disclosure] yes! Lol but it's been helping me focus my anxiety into being a bit more productive",
  "[Providing Suggestions] what do you want to hear from her? is there anything she could say that woudl make you feel better?",
  "[Providing Suggestions] No!! she's not going to be able to help you unless you need a witness for divorce court",

  "[Providing Suggestions] glad i could help. please stay safe and no matter what you decide to do, you will be fine.",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] So it's been more difficult for you to remain cheerful since the plandemic?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I actually have struggled with depression and anxiety most of my life so i can understand.",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] That doesn't sound helpful at all.",
  "[Self-disclosure] I have found a few things i do to keep myself from being to worried and depressed. They help a lot.",
  "[Self-disclosure] True, many people do not understand depression. I actually have found it easier to find a person who does understand and not talk to those who don't. When i talk to those who don't, it brings me down, so i find a good friend i can confide in.",
  "[Reflection of feelings] I can understand being discouraged to and not knowing who will understand you.",
  "[Other] I find it important to take care of my physical being first: eat well, drink water, exercise, get fresh air. Don't wear the mask if you can help it. Seeing smiles helps.",
  "[Other] I personally don't know anyone who has died and my nurse friends say it is no worse than the flu. So i try not to worry. What i think about is so critical. I try to pray about what i can't handle, then move on, change my thoughts.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Walking is great! This is a lovely time of year too!",
  "[Other] So to recap, find a good friend, get exercise, eat well, talk to people who will try to understand you. And of course, pray. The survival rate is 99.996% so the fact that you know no one who died is good news. I had flu like symptoms before this all happened and i still have a cough. They spray the skies too, so i try to not live in fear. There are a lot of consequences to fear, your heart beats faster, you stress yourself out, so it's important to not focus on negativity for too long.",
  "[Other] Here is a good saying -- if you want to change your feelings, change your thinking. Feelings are like the tail on the dog, they follow thoughts. So keep your thoughts positive, cultivate an attitude of gratitude, even write a list of of things you are thankful for.",
  "[Other] I'm almost 60 and my husband is 66. We refuse to live in fear. These are difficult times, no doubt, but i believe if you take the time to pursue good healthy, you will be better for it, emotionally and mentally and physically. All around!",
  "[Self-disclosure] Well, i hope i have encouraged you.",
  "[Other] So we are about the same age then! I encourage you to write down the strategy, while the ideas are simple, sometimes they are not easy! We must make a choice to do what is healthy! God bless you!",

  "[Other] It is here company",
  "[Information] you can also wfh even if your shop reopens",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes. She will tell you all about her program and where to apply.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] There is always an alternative to our work",
  "[Information] But if you go back to work, you can always change what hours you work from home",
  "[Information] Even part-time as a side job",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sorry to hear that. what's going on?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sorry, that's tough anytime but that's gotta be brutal because of the year and upcoming holidays.",
  "[Questions] what kind of work were you doing?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sorry to hear that. did they leave you with a severance package of any kind or anything?",
  "[Questions] Oh good so you've already applied for unemployment?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm guessing the unemployment office is pretty backlogged right now but at least you've got that done so far.",
  "[Questions] have you applied anywhere yet?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] End of year is tough with all the companies re budgeting for the following year. I'm betting things will open up early next year.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Have you considered gig economy jobs like uber or the grocery pickup apps?",
  "[Providing Suggestions] You'd need a vehicle for that too but there are plenty of other gig jobs out there. you should take a look.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] It may be an opportunity to test another kind of work",
  "[Information] In the mean time mturk is always a decent option...",
  "[Other] No problem happy to help!",
  "[Questions] Hello, how are you today?",
  "[Self-disclosure] I know how you feel, i have often felt anxiety before a job interview.",
  "[Questions] What makes you feel that you are unprepared?",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Is it possible that you could get a friend or family member to work with you on your responses? That could possibly speed up your preparation time.",
  "[Reflection of feelings] I can see that you are feeling a large amount of stress about the situation.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Would it be possible to take one or more days off from work to give yourself more time?",
  "[Self-disclosure] Yes, i have had to deal with time pressures quite a few times. I am sure most people have in the modern era where everything moves so fast. I have usually gotten help from friends, or done my best to delay or remove other commitments from my life. As a last resort, i have sometimes had to accept that i would be getting less sleep than usual for a few days.",
  "[Questions] Are there any other commitments that you can possibly delay or remove from your life while you prepare for your job interview?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] That seems like a good idea, unless that will be likely to cause you other problems. You seem like a hard working, diligent type of person that can make this work if you make the effort.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Well, everyone handles stressful situations differently, but there are some things you can do or try that might help. If you prepare as much as possible in the time that you have, you can be confident that you have done your best, and that is all that matters. You can decide that while you would like to get this new job, the world will not end if you don't get it, and you will worry less and have less stress. Also there is the classic technique of picturing your interviewer in their underwear. It makes them seem less imposing, and you can feel more confident.",
  "[Questions] Do you think any of these ideas might help?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Be confident in your abilities. You are the right person for the job, and if the interviewer does not see that, it is their failing, not yours. You will do great.",
  "[Questions] Excellent. I am very happy to hear that. Is there anything else i can help you with today?",
  "[Other] You are quite welcome. It was a pleasure speaking with you. Have a great day.",
  "[Questions] I'm sorry to hear that. Would you like to tell me more?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I could understand how that could make you very angry, i would be too.",
  "[Questions] I have not, it sounds like a very bad situation. Is there anyone you can report this to at the company?",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are working in a toxic work environment with poor leadership. Have you considered possibly seeking another job? Or maybe another company?",
  "[Providing Suggestions] I understand. What do you think about having a conversation with the board and let them know the issues you are having? You could have your coworker back you up.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you take a lot of pride in your job which is very amiable. I think confronting the board is the best way to go about this.",
  "[Other] It's very possible, but i think you will be commended amongst your peers. You owe it to yourself not to be walked all over.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] And who knows maybe the board will appreciate you coming to them, it shows great strength.",
  "[Questions] You're very welcome, was there anything else you wanted to discuss?",
  "[Other] Okay i hope i was able to help, good luck!",
  "[Questions] Why is that?",
  "[Self-disclosure] I have been angry with friends as well, but time loves a hero, as they say.",
  "[Questions] How long have your friends been neglecting you??",
  "[Questions] Any other questions for me?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I know it is hard at times, but be strong.",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] that's great you're doing well 'right now' but what happened prior that you weren't all right?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh i'm sorry. I'm sure you did fine. We all feel that way after exams!",
  "[Questions] have you felt this way with prior exams? if so, did you really fail or did you do okay?",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] wow 5 classes is a lot! So you didn't have time to study? Did you go to class and do the work throughout the semester?",
  "[Providing Suggestions] I wonder if you can contact the professor and go over your exam with him/her to set your anxiety at ease?",
  "[Questions] how do you get your exam grade and test papers back?",
  "[Questions] have you spoken to people in the class with you?",
  "[Providing Suggestions] maybe he'll curve the grade then if a lot of people didn't do well",
  "[Providing Suggestions] oh wow. hopefully you can re-take it then if you really didn't do well. I bet if you go through your notes and your book and compare to test questions you did better than you thought!",
  "[Other] if you're good you can quit (i can't!)",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] you, too! good luck :)",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] oh wow! I didn't know - 3 more minutes. We can do it! I'm glad i don't have to study and take exams. After the exams are the worst! Not too badly right now. But every day is a new day :)",
  "[Self-disclosure] that's insane! I did chem and bio one semester at the same time - with 8 hours of labs a week - i quickly changed majors. I respect what you're doing!",
  "[Self-disclosure] I am way past that stage - my son is starting college in the fall",
  "[Self-disclosure] I am a day trader - business is a lot easier :)",
  "[Self-disclosure] nice! it's really fun. I have a few 'gigs' i work on but that is my favorite. And thank you about my son. I don't miss school - he's already ready to graduate!",
  "[Other] you, too! Maybe we will meet again!",
  "[Questions] Hello there, how are you?",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Your relationship has ended? I am very sorry about that. And your boyfriend ended it?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] That was really wrong of him if you ask me. I think you might be better off without him.",
  "[Self-disclosure] I have been in this position myself and i know how painful it is but it turned out for the best for me - i now have a great relationship!",
  "[Other] Noone has the right to put you down like that. You really are better off without him.",
  "[Other] Can you think of something to do that will take your mind off him?",
  "[Questions] How long were the two of you together?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] He should not be treating you that way when you've known one another so long!",
  "[Other] I think that you should call one of your girlfriends and suggest you have a movie night. It would make you feel better",
  "[Other] Oh that is rough. That happened to me too when i broke up with my ex.",
  "[Questions] They all took his side? Not one took yours?",
  "[Self-disclosure] I tried to find some new interests. One thing i did was take a salsa class .. that was a great way to meet new people",
  "[Other] There are lots of other things you could do. Maybe you could take an evening class in something that interests you?",
  "[Providing Suggestions] I think also you need to think a bit more highly of yourself and not let idiots like this treat you so badly",
  "[Other] he seems to have damaged your self esteem badly",
  "[Providing Suggestions] No you did not! Please don't think like that",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I think that that is a normal reaction to feeling ill treated. I hope that it will pass soon and am sure that it will.",
  "[Information] There are a lot of therapy groups available that might be able to help you through this",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I think you really need to take it one day at a time. Things are very raw for you right now",
  "[Information] There are some organisations that will offer a certain number of sessions for free",
  "[Other] And yet here we are :p. Therapy can be surprisingly beneficial, i have found.",
  "[Self-disclosure] I do realise that it can be hard to open up to how we are feeling though. I know that i was",
  "[Other] I think that is useful to remember that we are all human and that most people have been hurt in this way at some point. No-one will be judging you",
  "[Questions] Do you think that this might partly because your ex has eroded your self esteem?",
  "[Other] The important thing is to gradually rebuild your self esteem. Do you have any things that you excel at?",
  "[Other] Animals are a wonderful source of comfort when we are feeling very low! Could you join a riding club to make some new friends?",
  "[Reflection of feelings] I can feel that you are starting to make progress already and are thinking of things that you can do post break up",
  "[Other] You are most welcome. Is there anything else you would like to talk to me about?",
  "[Other] Well, i wish you all the very best for the future. I know that things seem terrible right now but please believe me they will get better",
  "[Other] And you have a lovely day too. I know that you are going to be just fine in a few weeks from now. Stay strong!",
  "[Other] Hello dear how are you today",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] well, at the moment a lot of people seem to be stressed out about politics but on the brighter side, everyone is a winner",
  "[Other] However, talk to me, why are you stressed?",
  "[Self-disclosure] I say this based on the number of clients that i have had in the past one week.",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] ooh wow, she must have really been pushing your nerves to the core right about the biden win, right?",
  "[Reflection of feelings] well look, one thing i have always learnt about people who push others to the core is that they always have that competitive spirit in them to always want to win while hurting others feelings",
  "[Questions] what do you think of that",
  "[Other] I get it now. I believe she feels like she has finally gotten what she was yearning for after four years of trumps administration and now she is elated that her candidate has finally won right?",
  "[Other] well, let me ask you something. You've told me that you have been friends with her for a long time meaning that you understand her inside out right?",
  "[Providing Suggestions] wow that's a long time. How about you letting her know how you really feel about what she is doing to you emotionally. What do you think the outcome might be?",
  "[Information] I'm glad you feel better. but just a parting shot. Sometimes when one let's their friends know what is really bothering them makes the friends trust them more given that they are open with them and could tell them what they feel deep inside. That's what true friendship is about. It works wonders",
  "[Other] You are welcome. Bye",
  "[Questions] I'm sorry to hear this. Is there something specifically bothering you?",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] You don't think people like you or care about you at work? What specifically have they done to make you think this?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand that might make you feel uncomfortable.",
  "[Self-disclosure] I have been in many work situations and even social situations where i did not feel as if i fit in, i'm rather an unusual person. I had to learn to not focus so much on being accepted. I had to learn what god think of me (he loves me) and try to be kind to all i meet, other centered. That is, i also had to make sure i wasn't being rude or mean.",
  "[Reflection of feelings] I can understand how hurtful that is. Our society isn't as kind as it once was. I find very few people appreciate kindness. However, i can't get caught up in that, it's the way people are. It isn't a reflection of myself.",
  "[Self-disclosure] I think it is the hardest thing to be more concerned with others than we are with ourselves, it can be lonely.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] I think you can be kind to them, but i think perhaps your expectations are that they reciprocate, and they aren't which hurts. Perhaps be kind without expecting anything in return, and know that god sees your kindness.",
  "[Self-disclosure] I also had this happen, i had no friends and at first i thought it was me, then i realized it was an opportunity for personal growth. Which wasn't easy.",
  "[Reflection of feelings] How do you feel they take advantage?",
  "[Other] Being ignored is one thing, having someone take advantage of you is a different story.",
  "[Reflection of feelings] I understand. Yes, then they definitely are taking advantage. Have you read anything on setting boundaries and learning how to say no?",
  "[Providing Suggestions] I had learned once that it is so important to be able to easily say no because then we are free to say yes. Because if we say yes because we can't say no, then we feel resentful. So if i can freely say no to you, then i am free to say yes, if that makes sense. Although for me, it was hard to say no, but it gets easier, now it is easy. It wasn't at first.",
  "[Information] If i always say yes, because i can't say no, i feel obligated and resentful, when really, it's me with the problem, i had a hard time saying no because i didn't want to hurt people. Now, i do the right thing in my heart, if i want to help, i help, if i want to say no, i say no even if it is hard, i don't care if they get upset. I can say no, that's true freedom.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] I don't advise treating people the way they treat you though. I would remain a kind person. Be the person you are no matter what type of person they are. You have to stand before god one day. If they are ugly, that's on them. But you want to be a kind person. That's the right thing, and you can be kind and say no. Those two are fine together! :d",
  "[Providing Suggestions] I suggest a book called \"bounderies\" one of the authors is townsend -- great book.",
  "[Information] Might be on youtube too. Good stuff on how to say no and set boundaries! :d",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I think you have identified your problem and looked at it and you seem intelligent and caring! I'm sure you will be able to figure this out. You seem like a nice person to me, and i just met you. You seem emotionally mature, able to discuss your problems and think about it in a mature way.",
  "[Other] A lot of people will just blame others and not change. We can't change others, we can only change ourselves. That's the hard part but recognizing we can change and must is so important!",
  "[Other] You are welcome! Have a nice evening!",
  "[Questions] I am okay. How are you doing today?",
  "[Questions] What has happened?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I know a lot of people who are feeling this way. It is a difficult time",
  "[Questions] Why do you think you are struggling?",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are feeling lonely. Is that right?",
  "[Reflection of feelings] I understand. Video calls can feel a bit less personal sometimes. Do you live alone?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I see. So you aren't even getting that social contact at work really. Do you video chat to your family and friends regularly?",
  "[Self-disclosure] I feel the same way. Having to keep in contact with friends through video has been difficult lately. I try to find something to do while we're chatting, like gaming or a quiz",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] that is really tough. a lot of people are going through that, you are not alone",
  "[Questions] what kind of business do you have?",
  "[Reflection of feelings] christmas is right around the corner though, and it is almost the 15th. military get paid the 1st and 15th so there is still hope for a christmas rush!",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] tax season is right around the corner too... there is defineately still reason to keep hope",
  "[Questions] are you online or in store?",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] thats great then, online businesses are less likely to fail",
  "[Self-disclosure] you know, i am in construction and there are soo many zoom meetings. honestly, i was in an office with 4 people and hardly wore make up. now with all these meetings i amd doing meetings constantly and i have had to start wearing more make up to look more profesional",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] i know it can be scry, but you ust have to keep a positive attitude",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] also, i think it depends on where you are in the world. covid hit my area really hard around april/may, but things are completely back to normal now. people hardly wear masks, stores are open, it just takes time",
  "[Other] maybe you could distritubute samples to hospitals for the nurses as a christmas present. put your card in. you know they have job stability and it could lead to sales!",
  "[Other] if you have a facebook page you can always make a post saying you are giving back to the community by giving the essential workers chrismas gifts.... it could make people in your community want to support you back!",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] i think you will be fine. you are resourceful, you are supplementing income with mturk, thats awesome. you seem to have a good head on your shoulders",
  "[Self-disclosure] what is your problem?",
  "[Questions] explain to me?",
  "[Questions] i am with you ,share your problem to me.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] don't feel past is past.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] what happend ?",
  "[Reflection of feelings] you don't feel about anything.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] he was fake.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] believe your self and change your mind .",
  "[Providing Suggestions] obay your parents advice.",
  "[Reflection of feelings] you should tell them .they give a great solution .",
  "[Other] okay, good",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] yes ,definitely you ask them next you make very peacefull moment.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] god grace to you.",
  "[Self-disclosure] i will pray them.you don't feel any thing",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] you are a such a good person so you make good life.",
  "[Questions] Hello! How can i encourage you today?",
  "[Other] Sorry that posted twice! :o",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] You are growing apart from your best friend? Is this a good thing or not a good thing? Or you aren't sure?",
  "[Reflection of feelings] Ouch! That is a sad thing. As i was sitting here thinking about friends i have moved on from, sadly, most of the time it was for the best, even though it hurt at the time.",
  "[Self-disclosure] Life is a journey, and as we walk toward goals in our life, people either join us or bring us down. Sometimes they only walk on the path we are on for a short time, sometimes longer. I have very few friends from high school, 2 to be exact. And only on fb, that was back in 1979 too. lol i'm old, but i have had to move on from destructive relationships, as you are doing now. It can be hard.",
  "[Reflection of feelings] Ouch! That sounds hard. I had friends like that too. I had to walk away. Has your friend asked you why you are ignoring him? The reason i ask this is because it's good to get some closure and let them know their behavior is destructive and you need space from that.",
  "[Self-disclosure] I have learned in life that unhealthy people run from problems, healthy people stick in the mud with you and try to work out issues.",
  "[Questions] Have you other friends?",
  "[Information] Yes, and as you grow and mature, your life goals change, not everyone will travel with you. Right now you are starting out, i'm in the retired stage, lol now i'm interested in helping younger people. It's amazing how our priorities change.",
  "[Self-disclosure] I've basically figured out life only makes sense with god, and i don't worry about a thing now, very little upsets or angers me, it truly isn't worth it. A lot of people have no goals. I think this is actually a good time to examine the year, what you did right, what you didn't do so right, and where you want to go next year. I think self reflection is good for us.",
  "[Information] A young neighbor just stopped by today, and he just moved out of his home, he is consumed with how do i pay the electric, how do i budget? How do i cook? lol like it is so interesting to see the journey in life. And my faith in jesus christ is really the most important thing.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Do pray for your friend, and i will say a prayer too. Maybe he will come around some day?",
  "[Information] I had two brothers die from alcohol and drugs. I had to learn not to enable them. Sadly, people choose their own life. There is opportunity to get sober, my husband is a recovered alcoholic. When hanging with them and they do not want to change, sometimes the best thing to do is to walk away and let them hit bottom. I have 2 brothers that did find recover and a sister too. So my whole life was filled with people drinking and drugging. And i didn't want that life.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] there's a prayer called the serenity prayer, i don't know if you are familiar with it, but it is used in aa and na a lot, learning to let go of what we cannot change, and that is people,",
  "[Questions] Please tell me more about your story",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Please don't do that. You made the right decision to break up with him as he doesn't respect you at al",
  "[Other] I would say this, if he does it once, he will do it again",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Maybe going home isn't too bad after all. You may even meet someone better there",
  "[Other] From my experience, people who cheat always cheat again",
  "[Self-disclosure] Luckily i have never been in that situation but my friends have",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] But trust me, you made the right decision. If anything, it proves you're a strong and independent person",
  "[Reflection of feelings] People can only love and respect you when you treat yourself that way",
  "[Other] That's a great idea! Spend time with your friends and family, who actually care about you and your feelings",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] You are very mature. Anyone in that situation would feel the same.",
  "[Self-disclosure] He did a good thing at least, being honest with you. However, cheating, even just once, is something i always warn people",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I know it's useless to tell you to not be sad. Go ahead and let it all out by crying or screaming but please know you didn't do anything wrong",
  "[Other] I hope i can be help",
  "[Other] No problem. and don't see him again, it's tough but it's better that way",
  "[Other] you too, i hope you feel better",
  "[Other] Hello! My name is joe. It's nice to meet you! How are you doing today?",
  "[Questions] I'm so sorry to hear that! Is there anything specific going on that is stressing you out?",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds to me like covid-19 in general is causing you a lot of stress. Does this sound accurate to you?",
  "[Self-disclosure] I also have a compromised immune system, so i understand where you're coming from. All of this has been very scary.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I know it's tough, but i believe that if we all keep working together and talking through our feelings, we can make it through this!",
  "[Self-disclosure] I live alone as well and also need to take care of myself. It can be so hard at times.",
  "[Information] I found that spending less time on social media and less time watching the news has helped my anxiety level to an extent. I don't think you should completely stop listening to what's going on as it's important to stay informed, but for me, limiting the amount of time that i spend engaging in these activities really helped.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Have you thought about limiting how much time you spend tuning into news sources and especially on social media? I know it's hard because there isn't much to do.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Have you considered spending your time engaging in other hobbies? I've been doing a lot of arts and crafts (one in particular called diamond painting that can be ordered directly from amazon) and also reading novels that i can also have delivered right to my door. This also prevents me from having to go out in public.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Talking to me about how you're feeling is a great start! I'm proud of you for being open and honest about what's going on in your head. It's very easy for people to get stuck inside of their own minds right now.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Another suggestion i've been mentioning to others suffering from the mental stressors that covid-19 is causing is considering speaking to an outpatient/occupational therapist. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",
  "[Other] You're welcome! I'm more than happy to provide any help that i can. I'd also very highly recommend finding hobbies that you enjoy, even if arts and crafts or reading aren't your thing. Can you think of anything else that would help you to keep your mind off everything going on?",
  "[Providing Suggestions] I've also found that guided meditation (you can find a lot of these for free on youtube) helps to calm my mind down at night and allows me to get a really good night's sleep.",
  "[Other] You're very welcome! I hope that some of the things that i suggested help you to get through all of this.",
  "[Reflection of feelings] It seems as though you're feeling very similar to how i've been feeling.",
  "[Other] How has the weather been where you are? Sometimes, just getting outside for a brief walk alone or even just for a few minutes to get some fresh air can really be helpful.",
  "[Information] I found a few months ago that the more time i spent watching the news and following covid-19, the more depressed and anxious i got. I decided that i'd spend 30 minutes twice per week catching up on what's going on in my local area and around the globe. Other than that, i try not to focus on it as much as i can.",
  "[Other] Wow, it must be beautiful there! I'm in pennsylvania.",
  "[Other] Hello. How are you feeling today?",
  "[Other] I'm sorry to hear that.",
  "[Other] Please bare with me, this is my first time doing this. It is a little different on this end as a supporter.",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] This whole situation is hard. I completely understand where you're coming from.",
  "[Questions] Do you think that is out of fear of getting the virus?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I see. The whole virus is pretty scary, and it seems some people are very anxious about it.",
  "[Other] Living with parents can be hard when you're an adult as well.",
  "[Self-disclosure] I'm a bit older, 33. I have lived with parents though due to some financial circumstances. It was rough. I had kids at the time too.",
  "[Self-disclosure] Um, well they're my grandparents who i was raised by. So they from a different generation. I love them, but they were very annoying. And controlling.",
  "[Questions] I was glad when i got out of the house for sure! Are you able to talk to your parents at all?",
  "[Providing Suggestions] So you're feeling a bit ignored and maybe not listened to. Have you tried letting her know that you're not trying to insult her?",
  "[Self-disclosure] I have 2 teenagers. So i can feel where your mom is coming from. I also tend to get really defensive.",
  "[Other] Being a mother is one of the hardest things in the world! Sometimes we don't feel like anyone is listening or paying attention to us, and even worse being disrespectful :(",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Wow! It sounds like your mom may also be experiencing her own sort of emotional battles.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] I think that would be a great idea. You are older and more mature than my own teenagers, but sometimes us mothers just want to be loved and appreciated and to know we're cared for like we care for all of you.",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] I see ... so you're having a career dilemma and this is affecting your overall physical health?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Please try not to worry, this is a very common thing to happen to people. I will try to help you all that i can.",
  "[Questions] Do you feel as though another job might be more intellectually fulfilling for you?",

  "[Providing Suggestions] Have you contemplated seeing your doctor? They might be able to help with your anxiety.",

  "[Information] There are lots of different routes you can go down when it comes to treatment. Some people prefer therapy whilst others take medication, or a combination of the two.you have to find what works for you.",
  "[Questions] Do you feel as though covid is making your situation worse than it would otherwise be?",
  "[Self-disclosure] I have been having a really difficult year too. Roll on 2021!",
  "[Self-disclosure] Me too! Let's hope january brings better things for all of us.",

  "[Reflection of feelings] I totally understand. Losing your job is a very rough thing to go through, i'm sorry that happened to you. Feeling constantly at red alert is taxing both mentally and physically.",
  "[Self-disclosure] There is a concept called maslow's hierarchy of needs, and sometimes i find it useful to think about if my needs are being met, and which is lacking.

Whether those things are \"i have hot coffee and electricity\" or \"i won $1000 for free\", they will begin to start a small fire of joy.",

  "[Other] I’m glad i could provide you some support",
  "[Questions] Is there anything you want to talk about?",
  "[Reflection of feelings] Yeah, i've definitely felt that way...especially during covid and having to adjust to working from home. What are some of the things in your routine during the day?",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Yep, for me it's kind of felt like working remotely and all the crazy 2020 stuff was kind of an excuse to just \"take a break\" from grinding. Mturk has kind of helped me get back in a working mindset and given me more energy...have you been doing a lot of mturk lately?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Yeah it helps, just forcing yourself to have goals, for sure. I've been determined to hit a number on mturk and exercise every time i'm feeling tired, instead of taking a nap because my boss can't see me, lol. I would definitely say just start setting goals and try to look forward to 2021 being better.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Force yourself at first, then the \"body in motion, stays in motion\" law will take over. :)",
  "[Reflection of feelings] All i know, is that nothing is worse than ending a day without a sense of accomplishment and then stringing those kinds of days together.",
  "[Reflection of feelings] One of the things i've noticed about 2020 and i think this contributes is that this year has taken away almost all incentives...you know before it would be like, \"i'm looking forward to this concert, or this movie coming out next weekend.\" so, when you aren't planning things and don't have these milestones throughout the year of events breaking up the monotony, it stinks.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] I'm sure it will be. Definitely try tomorrow morning to get up and exercise and maybe hit the mturk hard, also hobbies definitely help and being at home is a great time to learn new skills.",
  "[Reflection of feelings] Oh yeah, nothing is worse than losing joy in something you love doing. But, getting back in an active mindset helps. I used to love to have bonfires, it really was therapeutic for me but then i just lost the will to have them. Since i've been back on mturk and trying to be more active these last couple weeks, i had one on saturday and really enjoyed it. So much of the passion lost for hobbies isn't because we grow out of them, it's quite frankly because we are probably just depressed.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Yep for sure, just get back at it and learn to love it again. Anyways, good talking to you!",
  "[Other] Hello",
  "[Questions] I am so sorry to hear that. How do you feel right now?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand that feeling. Have you lost interest in things that you normally would enjoy?",

  "[Questions] Would you be willing to try a new hobby to make each day less monotonous?",
  "[Other] Maybe a new home improvement project?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Those both sound like great ideas! I think starting one, or both, would really make you feel a lot better.",
  "[Other] I believe it will also help give you a sense of accomplishment. I know that it would me",
  "[Other] Perfect! It sounds like you may have found a solution to help you get out of this rut and \"blah\" feeling",
  "[Other] I hope that you start feeling better. I'm glad we were able to chat",
  "[Other] I glad that you were able to talk about how you are feeling. That is a big step in feeling better",
  "[Other] Enjoy your dinner! Goodbye",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] lots of people suffer from anxiety.you are not alone.",
  "[Questions] ok. well do you want to expand on what's causing the anxiety?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sure your parents know that if they can't drive they won't because they you are worried about them",
  "[Questions] have you spoken to them about your concern?",
  "[Providing Suggestions] well it's a atart. I suggest you talk to them about it. maybe they will take your concerns seriously",

  "[Questions] I know right! What would you do once it is over!?",
  "[Other] oh nice! I used to love drinking and partying.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] My suggestion is to do all you want to do, really. Because i think you know yourself really well.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] For a social bees like yourself, staying home would be stressful. I would call all your friends and make some plans for the next year, plans for nye 2022 etc",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I am guessing sometime summer next year? We get all shots and good to go.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] My friend suggested to get a party ticket for 1.5 year later. You're welome!",
  "[Information] Anytime, by the way, i bought a year worth tissues, kitchen papers and toilet tissues. Hoarding is not recommended but it relived my stress.",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] So covid has been especially hard on you?",
  "[Reflection of feelings] Just hearing that, i can imagine what a scary time this is.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Do your kids understand how helpful wearing a mask can be?",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] So sometimes you worry that they aren't doing enough to protect themselves.",
  "[Self-disclosure] I know i'm more worried about others than i am about myself right now.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Maybe just reminding them that wearing masks protects both them and others could help? They sure wouldn't want to infect you or your husband, or others.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] That is really relatable. I can understand how scary it is for you, especially with your husband's pay cut.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] What if you talk to a close friend when your anxiety is especially difficult ?",
  "[Self-disclosure] And with the holidays, i think it's really hitting a lot of us even harder right now. I feel that way too.",
  "[Questions] Have any of your coworkers gotten covid?",
  "[Other] I'm glad you're safe in that regard.",
  "[Questions] Is your husband working out of home or out in the field/office?",

  "[Self-disclosure] My husband's work was at a standstill until summer. It is better but shows signs of slowing down too.",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you're at least assured your income will be ok.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] That is very good news.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Maybe this is a good year not to worry too much about presents?",
  "[Other] I'm so glad to hear that. Good luck to you, and i hope you have a peaceful thanksgiving with your loved ones.",
  "[Questions] Hello, how are you tonight?",
  "[Questions] I'm doing well how can i help you tonight?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I can see where this would be frustrating. As parents our biggest goal is to keep them safe and healthy. Have you thought about having a conversation with the people you are around to inform them you'd wish they wear a mask?",
  "[Reflection of feelings] I understand how you feel. Can you tell me a little more about how it makes you feel when they don't honor your requests?",
  "[Providing Suggestions] I can see exactly how frustrated you are in this situation. Before i share some ideas do you have any ideas of ways to combat this issue?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Alright. Have you talked to your boss about working in areas where you can be around people less? Or possibly going part time for now and finding a lob that puts less danger on you and your family?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] We are going through some really tough times right now and i think that most people are very sympathetic. Especially for those who are in your shoes. Our children are our top priority and seeing them sick hurts us more than anything. How do you feel about talking to your boss about working in the office for a bit until things calm down a little?",
  "[Questions] Do you get paid vacation time in your job?",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Another suggestion that i have is maybe you could take some paid vacation time now rather than later to get away from people for awhile. I know it may not be the most fun time to do it but then you know you're keeping safe!",
  "[Providing Suggestions] I'm not sure of all the details on your job so i'm having a hard time making firm suggestions. How would you feel about that?",
  "[Questions] I am really sorry to hear that.. would you like to talk about it?",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, i hear you saying that you're not enthusiastic about having to talk about your problems?",
  "[Self-disclosure] I do understand. I've tried therapy myself and was very hesitant at first. But after a while i found it really did help",
  "[Questions] Do you feel ready to tell me what specifically is wrong?",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Well, let's take these one at a time. Firstly, is there something you could do to make friends? Join a group of some kind?",
  "[Providing Suggestions] What about something like a book club or a gym?",
  "[Other] You never know, you might also find a date there :)",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] No you are not. Thinking like that is a symptom of depression. It is perfectly normal but there is help available.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] I do understand. I have suffered severe depression and i know how debilitating it is. Can you see your doctor?",
  "[Questions] Would you be prepared to take medication? I know a lot of people hate the idea but it can really help.",
  "[Self-disclosure] I was talking about anti depressants :). I use prozac and it helps a lot.",
  "[Information] Yes - it is an anti depressant drug that was developed about thirty years ago. It works by preventing your brain from reuptaking serotonin",
  "[Information] Serotonin actually makes you feel good. In a depressed person it can be reuptaken by the brain too rapidly however, leaving you feeling low. Prozac prevents this from happening.",

  "[Information] Just click the button at the bottom :)",
  "[Questions] Hi! How are you tonight?",
  "[Other] Sorry that typed twice.",

  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] You made plans for christmas and a coworker quit? Are they asking you to work then?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand your frustration. You were a team player during thanksgiving so saying you are not seems like he wants you to feel guilty.",
  "[Questions] Is this a company where you see yourself getting a promotion?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Family is important. I can imagine how excited you have been to see your children again.",
  "[Self-disclosure] I have personally had to learn how to not buy into false guilt. If you had plans, then they can ask some people to help out. However, i would consider maybe being flexible one day or two, but not out of guilt, but out of concern. I would personally pray about it. It's a hard situation.",
  "[Reflection of feelings] I'm sure it will all work out. I have been in that spot. You want to help, but not because they guilt you into it, that seems unfair.",
  "[Other] Maybe they will offer double time? lol that would be nice.",
  "[Self-disclosure] I was just discussing with my husband how many people want to try and intimidate us lately. Seems so many are stressed out. I hope you have a merry christmas and really enjoy your visit with the kids.",

  "[Information] Feel free to end the conversation if you wish!",
  "[Providing Suggestions] I am sorry that you feel that way. Have you tried asking them why they don't express care towards you?",
  "[Providing Suggestions] If they don't see on the same level as you do then maybe it is time to seek new friends.",
  "[Information] It takes time to build friendships and relations. The best way to establish the connection is to find individuals who share similar interests with you.",

  "[Reflection of feelings] You are very welcome! I am glad i can help!",
  "[Questions] Is there anything else i can help you with?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sorry you are depressed. What's going on?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Sometimes it can help to just talk about things and get it off your chest.",
  "[Questions] Why do you feel that way? Could it be the people your surrounded by making you feel that way?",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] I think everyone's off this holiday season. It's not a normal christmas. You're not alone in feeling this way.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Has anyone specific made you feel this way? I would hope your family doesn't make you feel that your depression ruins christmas that's horrible",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I think you need to surround yourself with more understanding people.",
  "[Other] It can be challenging but there are understanding people out there. You can't always pick your family. But if they truly make you feel that way you aren't obligated to be there. That's horrible.",
  "[Other] I have struggled my whole life on and off. Learning triggers and ways to cope with them is very important. A positive mindset doesn't cute depression by any means, but it will help in accepting ways to cope",
  "[Other] You're welcome:) I hope you have a wonderful christmas and can surround yourself with positivity. Wish you all the best",
  "[Questions] Hello, how can i help you today?",

  "[Other] That's great! Maybe you can take that a step further and read some material on mindfulness",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, you don't feel like you have a secure spot right now, is that right?",
  "[Questions] Can you tell me what your job is?",
  "[Questions] Ok, have there been any talks about layoffs? Or any concerns about your performance?",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you're nervous about things that might happen in the future, but there's no talks about anything concrete?",
  "[Questions] Is there a general problem that you would like to talk about? I am more than happy to listen.",
  "[Other] I am sorry to hear that but try not to panic, just failing one class is not the end of the world. How do you feel about retaking it?",

  "[Questions] hi there, is there anything troubling you today?",
  "[Other] I am happy to talk about anything you might have on your mind.",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ouch that is a very long way. So you feel that you are going to be distanced from your loved ones and might lose touch with them?",

  "[Questions] Are there any comparably paid jobs that you could take that do not involve moving?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I do understand that the job market is really difficult right now. Would your siblings not be able to take care of your parents though?",

  "[Other] It is very difficult to know what to say. It is a big worry and i wonder if you can be happy in your new environment if you can't be sure that what you've left behind is okay",
  "[Questions] Is it possible that you are worrying unnecessarily though?",
  "[Information] Have you considered looking into other forms of help that your parents could have when you are not there? There are organisations that could check in on them",

  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I would just move on from it and let it go i wouldnt let that bring me down",

They weren't quiet but i could tell them here was something different in the way they were acting etc. It turns out that they had started a new relationship with another friend of mine and didn't want anyone else to know. In reality everything was fine. There was an explainable reason behind the behaviour and it was nothing bad in the end.",
  "[Information] That is true. Mental health issues have increased significantly since lockdowns began",
  "[Providing Suggestions] As they are not responding to your attempts to get in touch, you could think has anything else changed for them other than lockdown, for example are they busier at work? have childcare commitments? Life is complicated, they may not have the time for legitimate reasons.",

Also try to google \"how to become a first time business owner\" and see if any of this information helps you and your family.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] I know that it can be hard and frustrating during this time, but you have to remain focused for your family and stay strong because i am sure they look up to you.

  "[Questions] Why do you still want him even though, he broke up with you if you don't mind me asking?",
  "[Providing Suggestions] it might be hard, but isn't it better to see how things go without him. It's not good to be a relationship if someone isn't 100 percent dont you agree?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] it might feel like that now, but in time i am sure it will change",
  "[Self-disclosure] okay, in my opinion i believe its best to be strong and try and focus on yourself and live a good life without him for now, until he changes his mind then maybe you re-asses the situation.",

  "[Self-disclosure] Ive been through a few bad breakups myself in the past so i know how you must be feeling right now.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Well to be honest in some ways your life has been rearranged, but thats okay.

  "[Self-disclosure] After i had my daughter i had severe depression and thought that there was no way out, i went to the hospital and they referred me to a psychiatrist so i could get help.",
  "[Self-disclosure] I can say that it didn't get better over night, it took years of medication adjustments and a great therapist to get me through since i also did not have friends at the time and an unsupportive family.",
  "[Other] Reading is a great coping skill. What are some of your favorite things to read about?",
  "[Providing Suggestions] I recently read a study that suggested that reading fiction may lead to inceased empathy and this increased empathy help the reader basically pay it forward by being more willing to do good deads.",

  "[Other] She might be feeling receptive to that but if she's not you might have to accept that it's over.",
  "[Questions] How are you doing today?",
  "[Questions] What's the occurrence exactly that you are referring to?",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Oh wow! I'm so sorry! I can't imagine how you are feeling! Have you found anything to do to keep you busy? Or maybe some good distractions?",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Do you think you guys could reconcile your relationship? Is there any hope? Is she willing to work with you and work through her mistakes?",
  "[Providing Suggestions] It takes time. Sometimes, the best relationships occur when people work through the most difficult occurrences in their relationship. Have you tried talking to her? I would recommend talking to her when your emotions have settled.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] I would make a pros and cons list. If there are a lot of pros, i think it's worth a shot! Just give yourself time to process everything that has happened.

  "[Reflection of feelings] How do you feel about your husband not wanting to fix things? Is that something that you are considering?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] That is a very thoughtful thing for you to put your son first. He is lucky to have such a great mother, that obviously loves him.",

  "[Reflection of feelings] Have you thought about if you can trust him after that?",
  "[Self-disclosure] I can understand where you are coming from. I have been in that situation myself and it is not an easy place to be. For me, it took some time to accept that i deserved better than someone who didn't just want me. Is that how you feel?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Understandably so. I believe that this is just temporary and you will be amazed at how strong you are.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] If you are leaning toward not accepting not being enough for him, then i would suggest an exit plan. Call a family member, or friend, to see if you can stay there awhile. Have a cooling off period from your husband and reassess the situation",

  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, it sounds like you're both in kind of a transitional period in life. It's pretty normal for relationships to not necessarily survive through things like this",
  "[Reflection of feelings] Yeah, i mean it's never easy going through a breakup, but people change as they get older and mature, and they aren't necessarily going to still be compatible the whole time. Also i think it's important to not think of a relationship that peters out as a failed one. Just because it didn't last until one of you died doesn't mean it wasn't a success. I think people put too much emphasis on permanence.",
  "[Self-disclosure] Well i've got a couple decades on you, so i've been through this a few times before. Actually i'm still friends with pretty much all of my exes. I mean just because i'm not romantically involved with them anymore doesn't mean that they aren't still terrific people. Hell, i hung out with two of them just today.",

  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I know it is hard to forgive but i would suggest you should forget the incidence and move forward. Materialistic things should not have much importance than the relationship.",

  "[Self-disclosure]  same thing happened with me. On of my friend stole my favorite book when i was little. I never talk to her forever. After 10 years i came to know that she is suffering from a disease. I felt guilty that why i stopped talking to her only for a book. I would suggest you should move forward and forget the incident.",

  "[Providing Suggestions] Have you looked into financial support for people in your situation who care for others, such as government support or subsidies?",

  "[Self-disclosure] I had a student who was a genius (by my standards) helping me and he was so patient and understanding. This lessened the pressure and helped me move forward successfully in the class.",
  "[Reflection of feelings] Yes, i understand that sometimes being able to interpret things from someone who can communicate well can make the difference in understanding things.",
  "[Self-disclosure] Yes, i had a 100% average almost in high school and still struggled with the class. I kind of wish they videotaped the classes that i could rewind and go back to at the time of college. When i got to grad school, i ended up being able to audio record sessions and understood things so much better because i could reference the books while listening to a lecture. That made so much difference.",
  "[Information] Lots of research also has shown that getting enough sleep is important for performance as well.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you are making efforts to do your best to sleep and understand the materials. You can give yourself a pat on the back for all the great efforts!",

  "[Information] it is true that relationships can have a big impact on us especially when the end suddenly and seemingly without reason. this must be very stressful.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] it does take time to get over a breakup especially one that ends suddenly but i think once you get over the initial shockyou seem like a positive person so i believe you can get over this",
  "[Providing Suggestions] do you have any friends or family that you can talk to about your feelings?",
  "[Information] speaking to others who have had similar experiences it's always a good idea. they may be able to offer a fresh perspective that you haven't considered before",
  "[Providing Suggestions] that's good, i'd definitely reach out to her, especially when the break-up is so fresh. you may not be thinking clearly and a friend that understands might really help.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] you have been through a really tough time. I do think you can get through this though and come out the other side. I believe you can do it!",
  "[Reflection of feelings] I can tell that you are worried that you will be lonely forever and i can tell you are anxious about that.",
  "[Other] It is a big world out there and there will be someone else that is right for you. Personally, if he cheated then it may be a good thing that you found out now and not further down the line, after you had invested even more time into the relationship.",
  "[Questions] Hi, i'm sorry to hear that. What's been happening?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] That's not very fair. You deserve to feel valued at your workplace and it sounds like you don't feel that way.",

  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] You could bring it up with your boss. That would be a very brave thing to do.",

  "[Questions] has anything changed recently in your life that you think might be contributing to this feeling of depression that you are having?",
  "[Self-disclosure] I'm sorry to hear that. my friend lost his job about 6 months ago and he was also feeling a similar way. I think this is to be expected when you have a sudden change in circumstances however this by no means undermines the seriousness of the issue",
  "[Providing Suggestions] that's great to hear. it sounds like if you address the issue that has made you depressed in the first place this will go a long way to making you feel better about things.",
  "[Information] I haven't had this issue personally but a friend has. It is true that your job also forms an important part of your identity and when your job situation change is it have a big impact on your personal life and mental well-being.",

  "[Providing Suggestions] I like \"sleep with me\" and \"anxiety slayer\".",
  "[Other] You're welcome! Bye",
  "[Information] Ah im sorry to hear that. Best advice i can give is to play for exactly that.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Like maybe get your resume cleaned up, cast some lines out for employment now, checked linkdin, worst come to worst, make sure you know how to fill out unemployment for the future.",
  "[Information] If you have a plan already it will ease some of that anxiety that will come from this tough situation",
  "[Information] Unfortunately, life doesnt always do what we want. What we can do is plan ahead though. It will make you less anxious if you know you have a back up plan.",

  "[Information] It might make you feel a bit better, maybe they can give you some perspective as well.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Its not something that will go away instantly, its something you have to work at. If it is really affecting your life in a negative way, talking to a therapist might really help you.",
  "[Other] Im glad you think so",
  "[Self-disclosure] Im glad, before then, what helps me calm down is going for a nice hike or run. It really lets me clear my head. Do you have anything you like to do to recenter yourself?",

  "[Self-disclosure] As a mom as well, i know there are many demands and things to juggle. Is there something specific you're struggling with?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I completely understand, the pandemic and having added responsibility definitely has been very isolating and can feel like you're losing your sense of self.",
  "[Reflection of feelings] It's completely normal to have that sense of guilt for feeling that way as well. This whole situation is not ideal for anyone, which somehow makes it worse. It's hard to talk to someone about these feelings when you know everyone else is in the same or worse situation.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] It's taken a while to figure it out and get on the same page with my husband, but i try and practice self-care when possible. It can be something as simple as going for a walk alone or sitting and reading alone. There's no shame in needing some time alone to reset.",
  "[Other] I'm glad to hear it, good luck to you as well. I hope you're able to practice self care and reset. Stay safe!",
  "[Other] Too kind, thank you.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] You as well, i'm so glad you're feeling better.",
  "[Questions] Hello. How are you today?",
  "[Questions] What can i help you with?",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Have you tried confronting them and asking why they are being bullies?",

  "[Information] No, beating them up will only get you in trouble and that won't help.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I think that could be a good idea if it's not too far out of your way.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] You could also tell a teacher what is happening. They will help you out.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I bet you are handsome! Don't let it get to you.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Try to tell yourself you are good looking and deserve good things to happen every morning! Look in that mirror and tell yourself good things.",
  "[Self-disclosure] Working out will help a lot! When i was feeling down on myself i decided to go to the gym three times a week. It was a great confidence boost.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] That sounds like a fantastic idea.",
  "[Questions] Hi how are you?",
  "[Questions] What's going on?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I know the feeling. what do you do for work?",
  "[Questions] how long have you been in your role? and do you have any coworkers that feel similar to you that you know about?",
  "[Self-disclosure] Somewhat similarly i'm in a supply chain role, for a year now, and the only one at my level too. I often feel like i'm alone in my job and that i manage my boss... It's pretty frustrating.",
  "[Questions] is there anything that makes your job less stressful?",
  "[Questions] do you think your boss would be receptive if you did talk to them? or would they dismiss your concerns?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] This has been a pretty hard year for everyone. however you ultimately gotta do whats best for you.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Have you considered searching for a new job?",
  "[Providing Suggestions] I'm in the same boat. I would say, the things that work best for me, are to take breaks during my work day and go for walks or as soon as i'm done with work i force myself to go for a walk. I find moving helps me feel better. I also use that time to think about how i can look for a new job or rethink the things that are bothering me",
  "[Providing Suggestions] maybe you can try something similar?",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Change the scenery, it'll help! plus movement releases endorphins which make you feel better.",
  "[Other] no problem!",
  "[Questions] I'm doing well, thank you! I'm sorry to hear that you're having a rough day. Do you mind me asking what happened to make you feel that way?",
  "[Self-disclosure] I am so sorry to hear that. My brother suffers from alcoholism as well. I know how worrisome and difficult it can be. I still have a hard time dealing with my emotions. What different types of emotions are you feeling?",
  "[Reflection of feelings] Wow, that really is a lot to deal with. It seems as though you have a good understanding of what you're feeling but that you are trying to figure out how to move forward from here. It seems like you are trying to figure out how to work through your feelings as well as how to manage and deal with the pressure that has been put on you as a result. Does that sound accurate to you?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] That is a great attitude to have. I'm very proud of you for trying to stay positive and for reassuring yourself that it will become easier for you to deal with over time. You sound like an incredibly strong person!",
  "[Information] You're very welcome! I know from experience that it is usually best and much easier to talk to someone on the outside who doesn't know all of the ins and outs of what you are experiencing.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Have you considered any ways in which you could start to work through what you're feeling?",
  "[Providing Suggestions] It's great to hear that you are on a medication that will hopefully help you. Have you also considered speaking to an outpatient therapist or someone along those lines? That way, you could return to the same person as often as you feel necessary to continue to work through your feelings with someone who isn't directly involved with your situation.",
  "[Other] I think that focusing on different hobbies that you enjoy is an incredible way to take your mind off of everything and to keep yourself busy! What types of hobbies are you into?",
  "[Information] I completely agree. I used to see a therapist. It was very difficult for me to do in the beginning, but once i got to know them, they provided me with coping strategies that otherwise, i never would have thought of. One of my favorites that he introduced me to was guided meditation. Have you ever heard of it?",
  "[Providing Suggestions] That sounds awesome! You should look into a relatively new craft called diamond painting. I started doing them back in 2018 and it completely turns my brain off from the outside world.",
  "[Other] You are very welcome! In my opinion, the best place to get one from to start with is amazon. That way, you can get them in a few days as opposed to having to wait for weeks or months for them to arrive from other countries.",
  "[Questions] I am so sorry for your loss... When did this happen?",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Wow that is horrible, and you don't sound redundant at all.",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand that loss is a painful thing to go through and can take us a while to learn to cope with it.",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] I take it you two were close?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I completely understand that. It is important to be able to let yourself heal.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Don't beat yourself up over things that we can't control.",
  "[Questions] What do you mean?",
  "[Reflection of feelings] I think that you need to understand that things happen about of our control and to not just accept it and forget it, but maybe put a day aside every year to celebrate her life.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] My grandmother was amazing, and loved burritos, so we used to make them together. After she passed, we started making them as a family in order to celebrate the life she had and memories of her.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] That helps us all remember not her death, but her life and the good memories in a way that would show her how much you do care.",
  "[Questions] Do you celebrate christmas?",
  "[Providing Suggestions] I do, merry christmas to you too!",
  "[Reflection of feelings] It has been a very different year, i am glad we are nearing the end of it.",
  "[Information] Is there anything else i can help you with?",
  "[Providing Suggestions] I understand that i am glad to listen. It helps me just as much.",
  "[Other] No problem you have a great rest of this year!",
  "[Other] Thank you! Enjoy!",
  "[Reflection of feelings] It sounds like there maybe something you need to get off of your chest.",
  "[Questions] What happened that made you guys break up?",
  "[Self-disclosure] I have also had this situation happen to me. Maybe it just wasn't the right timing or she had other interests.",
  "[Information] The first step of a break should be to starting loving thyself. If you get out there and find hobbies you enjoy, who knows, you may find someone that will love you more than you could imagine. Take it from me, i've had this happen. Sitting around sulking about it is only going to delay things in your life.",
  "[Questions] What is your age?",
  "[Self-disclosure] You still have your whole life ahead of you. Some people don't find a partner until their 40's or even 50's. When i left my ex i found this guy that i truly fell in love with. He is still sulking in his living room. I told him that if he didn't move one that he wouldnt get anywhere in life. I told him that if he cared about me, he would move on because thats truly what i would want him to do and i think thats what your girl would want you to do as well.",
  "[Questions] Did she give you any reasons to why she wasn't in love anymore?",
  "[Questions] Did you ever think she maybe possibly has been cheating?",
  "[Other] Has she ever tried to hide text messages, lock her phone, or tell you she is too busy to come over?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Im sorry that this stressful for you. In my past, i have had exes do that to me. Most likely she was cheating on you and this was the reason for her motives.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] I would definitely confront her about it. I wouldn't get angry or fight about it. Maybe she if she has a new boyfriend already. That is a really good indicator.",
  "[Information] I would calmly ask her. She will most likely deny it. But, some ofher friends may already know about this. If she says she did, ask her if there was something you did wrongthat made her do it. Sometimes its not even the cheatee. Sometimes they just do it for no good reason.",
  "[Questions] I'm doing okay. What's going on? What has you so down?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh, i'm so sorry to hear that! So many people have been furloughed this year.",
  "[Questions] Do you think they will bring you back?",
  "[Questions] I'm sure that has you anxious and probably a little depressed. Are you looking for other employment opportunities yet?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] It's good that you were able to find another job, but i completely understand about the take home not being enough. Do you work full time, or is it just part time for now?",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Oh, i understand being nervous about covid exposure, especially if you're working with the public, who may not abide by mask mandates and social distancing. Is there anything you can do to limit exposure?",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Also, are you able to look for a second job at all? The extra hours may bring in extra income while you try to find a single job that would pay enough.",
  "[Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you're really frustrated. That's completely understandable.",
  "[Self-disclosure] That is very frustrating. I know i find it very annoying when i see people out and about without masks. It drives me crazy, just thinking about how they're keeping this stupid pandemic going and keeping people out of work.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] I wish i had more suggestions for you. I think the only thing you can do is keep looking, make sure your resume is updated and current. If there are any employment agencies in your area, they may be worth looking into. And if there are any public assistance programs you qualify for, there's no shame in seeking help when you need it.",
  "[Other] I sure hope it does. I wish you all the luck in the world.",
  "[Other] You're very welcome. I'm glad i could be here for you.",
  "[Questions] Is there anything else you'd like to talk about?",
  "[Other] Okay. Have a good night!",
  "[Other] I'm good, you can go ahead and tell me your problems",
  "[Questions] Can you tell me what happened that makes you consider that?",
  "[Questions] Have you told him how you feel and asked him to stop doing that?",
  "[Reflection of feelings] Ok, it's a good thing that he stopped. What he did was bad though, no denying that.",
  "[Other] Maybe he feels ashamed about watching porn, that's why he tried to hide. I would hate it too if my partner watches porn",
  "[Questions] Other than that, is there anything else?",
  "[Reflection of feelings] I think you should be firm, let him know how much you hate what he did and how much it affected you. I think it's a serious issue, him not being honest with you over trivial things. At the same time, breaking up without any other issues is kind of not optimal considered you;ve dated for 1 year",
  "[Questions] Did you see any changes in behavior after that?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] you should tell him that, and let him the problem is you feel disrespected when he watches porn while dating you",
  "[Reflection of feelings] I am so sorry to hear that, you are not oversensitive at all. Trust me, any normal girls would feel the same",
  "[Other] Breaking up over this is a pity, however, he doesn't seem trustworthy after everything you told me. How about give him some time, 3-6 months and see if he changes at all. If not or if you really think he's not worth your time, go ahead and cut tie with him",
  "[Other] you deserve someone who respects you, it doesn't take that much either",
  "[Questions] I am sorry to hear that, would you like to go into what happened?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes sorry, the app was having trouble sending.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Well it may seem that if you were fighting all the time, it was for the better.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Right now, the best thing for you to do, is to focus on yourself. You deserve some time for yourself.",
  "[Self-disclosure] I hear ya, its been a while but i abruptly ended a 10 year relationship in the past. I wont sugar coat it, its a bumpy road, but one that leads to a better you!",
  "[Providing Suggestions] It feels that way right now. I understand, its a fresh wound, that takes time to heal. Im telling you do not focus on future relationships now. Focus on making yourself happy. Talk to friends, join an online club, start a new hobby.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Yea i understand, and i wouldnt risk your health right now to meet a person face to face. There are many apps and online message boards to talk to others. Can have a zoom party or something similar.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Well, maybe its time to get a new fish? A new fish for a new chapter in your life.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Chewy.com is great",
  "[Information] heh, as someone who has salt water fish, sharks are very hard to take care of.",
  "[Information] Betas can be beautiful and its a common misconception they need those tiny bowls and cannot live with other fish.",
  "[Other] I am glad that you are feeling a bit better. I hope you continue on this path!",
  "[Questions] can you tell me more about that?",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you're physically attracted to doug and had a one-time encounter with him. Is that right?",
  "[Questions] can you tell me more about how you're feeling now?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sure it's frustrating that you're not getting the emotional support you need. It's great that you are reaching out to communicate with someone.",
  "[Self-disclosure] I can sense your frustration, and his marriage just adds to that. I've known lots of people who've ended up in relationships with married people.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Just reaching out to talk with someone else is a great first step.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Sometimes, a good first step is to reach out to friends who can help you fill your time and avoid interactions with him.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] And co-workers often can help you find ways to avoid him in the office. Are others aware of the relationship who can help you with that?",
  "[Other] I can hear your anguish, and i understand your frustration. It's not clear to me, though, that doug is being honest with you or with his wife.",
  "[Questions] You mentioned that doug can't provide the emotional support that you need. Do you think he's being fully honest with you about his relationship with his wife?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] You're absolutely right. It sounds like doug is the problem. He's cheating on his wife, and he's not giving you the emotional support you need.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] With the holidays coming up, maybe you could avoid him for an extended stretch and really do something about what it is you are looking for in a partner.",
  "[Other] I wouldn't say that doug's wife is part of the problem. She's sounds like another victim of his philandering and dishonesty.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] You're right. It's best to err on the side of caution when it comes to covid. But remember that doug isn't your loved one alone. He's sharing germs with both you and his wife. Maybe a lockdown -- emotional and physical -- will help you work to find an end to this relationship.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] How did you spend your time before you met doug? Perhaps you could reconnect with other friends or find a hobby to fill your time.",
  "[Reflection of feelings] I absolutely have had my heart broken, yes. And i've spent some holidays alone. I can understand your pain.",
  "[Other] It would be great to be able to give you an easy and pain-free solution, but i don't know that that is possible when it comes to matters of the heart. If you truly love doug and want to be with him, you should tell him that and see how he responds. You mentioned, though, that he can't give you the emotional support you need.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] If you truly believe, in your heart of hearts, that doug can't be your everything, then you already have the answer: he is not \"the one.\" he's the one right now. And you shouldn't have to settle for that. You sound like a strong and capable woman who should be loved and respected for everything she is.",
  "[Other] I regret my assumption. I hope you can find happiness!",
  "[Questions] Hi! How are things going today?",
  "[Reflection of feelings] I'm sorry that you are having a bad day.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Can you think of something that might make you feel a little better, maybe listening to your favorite music or self care?",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Perhaps make a list of good things about the relationship and the negative things about it. Sometimes we only think of the good things and the truth gets distorted because we are lonely.",
  "[Information] If the bad outweighs the good, it means that it was meant to end in order to open up new doors for you. It means there is someone more compatible for you out there.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Breakups can be devasting. But take this time to do some nice things for yourself and decide what you really want in the next relationship.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Set your standards higher. Don't accept anything less",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Sounds like a plan. Keep yourself busy and remember everything happens for a reason.",
  "[Other] Why would you think that?",
  "[Providing Suggestions] If the two of you are broken up, perhaps he does not want to give you any false hope that things can be worked out. Or.....he could just be a jerk. Either way, put yourself up higher than that and reflect on what you can improve on yourself without blaming yourself. Trust me, there is someone better for you that will bring you happiness.",
  "[Questions] Hello??",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] I see, that is a problem.",

  "[Questions] Do you live alone?",

  "[Providing Suggestions] On fb in groups. I got to chatting with the same people, then began to inbox and then asked them if i could call. If you are in a group, you could even ask if anyone else would like to connect as friends. I am a woman, so i just picked women.",

  "[Information] Are there any churches feeding people on christmas? Sometimes that is a great way to meet others and help too.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I know it can be very difficult to be alone, why not input your town name in the fb search ad, maybe join local groups to see if there are any civic activities too.",

  "[Self-disclosure] Have you tried meditation and/or deep breathing exercises? I know i find that helpful when i am worrying.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] One exercise i find helpful is lying on my back with a pillow under my head. I keep my legs bent and put a pillow under my knees for support. I then put one hand on my chest and one on my diaphram and slowly breathe through my nose feeling my stomach press against my hand. I then exhale slowly through my nose and repeat for about 10 minutes. It can be very calming.",

  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Yeah, a box fort is really fun!",

  "[Self-disclosure] Last christmas when i gave gifts to my family, one of them later told me that the gift they loved the most was the box of christmas cookies that they were able to enjoy over the course of the week afterwards, and not the keyboard i had gotten them.

  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Perhaps it's like following through on your work goals is challenging enough, and then there's a bunch of unnecessary effort on top of it to work around the politics.",
  "[Self-disclosure] Yeah, maybe i have. I guess i've been in situations when i was surprised and confused as to why a team couldn't just work together towards the common goal. Does that sound similar?",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] For sure. It's true that you don't *have* to work there, but i'm sure there are factors in play that make it difficult to leave.",
  "[Questions] Here's a blunt question- what do you want to do about it? Do you think you want to get better at being happy in this job? Or work towards getting another job?",

  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Nice! That's a good first step.",
  "[Questions] And it's a step that doesn't cost anything to do. Just some time, maybe. Do you think you have enough time nowadays to start looking into that?",
  "[Reflection of feelings] Yep, for sure. It's not going to be easy.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Most likely! The only thing keeping me from saying definitely is because i don't know all the info. But sure.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I gotta believe that switching careers is much more common nowadays than it was one or two generations ago. People you meet along the way will understand.",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Absolutely. Work can affect mental health particularly when it seems like your efforts aren't going towards anything meaningful. Is that how it feels at your job now?",
  "[Information] Good to know. Because maybe that's something you could keep in mind when you think about new jobs. Does this job allow me to see meaningful outcomes from my effort, and so on.",
  "[Other] That's cool, thanks for saying that. It was nice talking with you!",
  "[Questions] when did this start?",
  "[Questions] i see. have you sought out any medical help with the back pain?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] yeah, this pandemic has thrown a wrench into many people's plans, but hopefully things will ease up soon.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] it is a bit daunting when we see the number of infections increasing and people getting sick, but i think it will just be a matter of time before things get better. and hopefully a vaccine will help with the hospitalizations",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] i think you're already taking a step in the right direction by talking to me about your anxiety and depression. i'm amazed that you've been able to just deal with it for 8 years",
  "[Self-disclosure] i've had friends who suffered from anxiety and depression, and i've noticed that just talking things through can sometimes help a lot",
  "[Reflection of feelings] i'm very sorry to hear about your mother's passing, and a significant loss like that can take some time to process",
  "[Providing Suggestions] from my experience, it really helps just to open up to someone about the things that are on your mind. even a journal can help. if you have someone who can lend an ear to listen and a shoulder to cry on, spending some time with them can help you get your feelings out and might give you a sense of relief",
  "[Providing Suggestions] personally, i find that hobbies are great for getting your mind off things and keeping yourself occupied means that your mind doesn't wander into dark thoughts",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] just from this limited conversation, it sounds like you're an amazing person and i sincerely commend you for seeking help here and pushing yourself to cope with you loss and pain. i really wish there was more i could do to help but i believe in you ;)",
  "[Providing Suggestions] this might sound silly, but reddit is a great resource. there are some great support groups there who help each other and lift people up",
  "[Other] you're very welcome, and thank you for your kind words. stay strong and i know you can get through this. i don't know what the rules are on sharing personal contact info here, but i'm happy to be a friend or pen pal if you just need someone to talk to",
  "[Other] you too!",
  "[Questions] Hello. How are you?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Sure, you can tell me anything. I won't judge or anything like that.",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Oh dear, that sounds like a classic love fraud.... I'm so sorry you were victimized like that.",
  "[Reflection of feelings] Oh my. I hate to hear that. Bank details should never be given out to people you don't know. This person made you think they cared about you, but they were trying to earn your trust and gain access to your accounts from the start.",
  "[Reflection of feelings] That person is just a scammer. They probably reach out to hundreds of potential victims every day, waiting for someone to bite. I'm sorry you were taken in by them.",
  "[Questions] Were you able to recover any of your loss?",
  "[Reflection of feelings] Scams like that have been going on for years. They just change how they go about it and what platform they use.",
  "[Other] You're very welcome. Please be more careful in future.",
  "[Other] I do hope you were able to recover your loss. I wish you luck and hope you can find someone honest and true.",
  "[Other] Goodbye. Have a good night. I hope you feel better.",

  "[Other] yes",
  "[Other] i am here",
  "[Questions] Why are you not coming back?",
  "[Questions] What kind of health risks are you concerned about? I imagine that hasn't been easy couple with the tough home environment.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I think you are doing the right thing by being careful. During these times, keeping loved ones safe is more important than having gatherings.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Do you think it would be helpful to express those health concerns with your friends?",
  "[Reflection of feelings] I understand how you feel. I'm currently saving up to move out myself because i think it would give me a chance to think for myself.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I don't think you should feel guilty about that because you are looking out for yourself which is the most important thing. And it always helps to voice your feelings to your friends. Whether or not they choose to accept it, just getting things off your chest can help too.",
  "[Reflection of feelings] That's good! It's definitely a great thing to look out for yourself rather than trying to please people all the time especially if it makes you feel uncomfortable in the process.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] You are very welcome, i can relate so i definitely understand where you are coming from.",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Hello what can i help you with today?",
  "[Reflection of feelings] i am sorry you are having problems with a friend. When did this start?",
  "[Questions] what seems to be the problem?",
  "[Questions] What was the fight about?",

  "[Self-disclosure] I am very sorry. I have been through something like this myself in the past so i do understand.",
  "[Self-disclosure] I think it was at least a year before i felt truly myself again and that i was able to enjoy life",
  "[Reflection of feelings] I can tell that it's all very raw to you at the moment. You really need to step away and give yourself some time to heal",
  "[Questions] What sort of obligations do you feel that you have? You need to be kind to yourself at the moment",
  "[Questions] It is good of you to be so caring and responsible towards your family. Do you think that perhaps you are taking too much on yourself though, especially at such a difficult time?",
  "[Other] I think that that is an excellent idea and that you are being very mature about this.",
  "[Questions] Are you in contact with your ex at all?",
  "[Self-disclosure] That seems sensible. I had a problem with not contacting my ex when we split. I kept wanting to talk to him again even though i knew that i should not",
  "[Self-disclosure] A restraining order :d",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] In all seriousness though, with hindsight i realise that our separation was for the best. I think and hope that you will realise this in time too",

  "[Providing Suggestions] Might i suggest taking up a new hobby and making some new friends?",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you feel anxiety about this whole covid-19 epidemic?",
  "[Self-disclosure] Oh well i understand your concern then. As a son or daughter it is certainly reasonable to be concerned about your parents especially as they grow older. I have a similar situation with my own mother.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Well first of all, you have to take care of yourself because if you don't you can't help them. So just take a moment to close your eyes and take some deep breaths and realize you stressing is probably going to make them stress.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Well if you can get some concrete info such as from the cdc and john hopkins showing case counts in your area. Show them graphs so they can visually see the impact. Also if you can get a hold of their doctor yourself, see if you can convince them to give your parents a call, say to check on them and give them some advice.",
  "[Information] Don't get absorbed in the numbers, it can drive you crazy. Also if you are using social media like twitter and getting inundated with info, remember a lot of it is fake. I would suggest limiting exposure for a little while just to get you fixed a little bit, if that makes sense.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Not particularly social media because it open to everyone, just pick and choose where you choose to get info from. The cdc is a great resource as well as the john hopkins site which has been tracking since the beginning. Everybody has a couple of news outlets they trust, use those.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] First of all you are not alone. but don't let them see you anxious for sure. You can also show them if they can how to do video visits. You can do that all the time, even phone calls every day. It means a lot.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Nothing will make grandparents smile more than seeing their grandkids on a video call. If you don't want to bring them when you physically visit have them record themselves on your phone as an example.",
  "[Information] Of course. I don't know if they dressed up for halloween, but see if they want to dress up and take some pictures for grandma. Pictures and voice and video are wonderful in these times.",
  "[Other] You too, i hope i helped. Take care!",
  "[Questions] Hi! I am sorry to heard that. I would be very glad to help if you could please tell me what bothers you",
  "[Reflection of feelings] I can see why you are concerned. These are certainly difficult times and this pandemic doesn't seem to be stopping anytime now. I understand your frustation.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Many apps offer videocalls that you can use to chat with your loved ones though. Zoom is a great one, fore example!",
  "[Information] It surely does. You can always travel, just make sure that you are maintaining social distancing and your mask at all times. If you and your family members follow the protocols, it is very unlikely that any of you is exposed to the virus.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand. It's especially risky when kids are involved.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Hey, you need to remind yourself that things will not be this way forever. A vaccine will be developed soon, and things will be just like they used to!",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] When the pandemic first started, i felt like i was frozen in my life. Nothing was happening and any signs of progress had stopped. I can definetely relate. However, i found that exploring new hobbies and focusing on improving as a person were great ways to take good use of time.",
  "[Information] That's great! I heard that some people are even deciding to grow their own food as much as possible. That greatly helps the environment and avoids pollution and global warming. Are you planning on applying that as part of your gardenning hobby?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] It's great that you are doing an activity that you enjoy. I can just imagine how beautiful of a scenery that creates.",
  "[Other] Teaching your kids is a great idea! Not many kids nowadays enjoy a lot of outdoor activities. Being in connection with nature is important to maintain a balance and increase our happinness overall.",
  "[Reflection of feelings] Haha that does sound like fun. Just watch out for any insects on those fruits or any impurities!",
  "[Questions] Sorry to hear. What's going on?",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Sorry to hear that. An investigation on who? you?",
  "[Information] That's unfortunately. Have you talked to someone in upper management about this?",
  "[Reflection of feelings] That is understandable. People can be hard to deal with at times. What did the co-worker do that upset you?",
  "[Questions] Oh, that's unfortunate. Have you brought this issue to upper management in the past?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Sorry to hear. Has upper management done anything about this issue?",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Well, in my opinion, i think you did the right thing. Has anyone else mentioned her rudeness in the past?",
  "[Questions] I was wondering, how long has she been an employee at your work?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] No, i think you did the right thing.",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Wow, 5 month and she's still there.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, i hope everything works out for you.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Hello, i am doing well. How are you doing today?",
  "[Reflection of feelings] Oh, it sounds like you are stressed from the academic pressure that you are facing right now?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I see how this can be stressful for you and your fellow peers. Have you tried other steps besides the one's you tried before by contacting the professor?",
  "[Reflection of feelings] I can relate to this because it is hard to work and do school as well. I can tell it makes you feel concerned about your schooling and you want to do the best you can.",
  "[Other] You are doing great i believe and really trying hard to do your schoolwork right.",

  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, i agree. Sometimes it just takes time to process all the emotions.",

  "[Information] It is understandable to want to keep photos. Distracting yourself might not be the solution; that could stop you from processing the emotions. There is a stage of grieving for a lost relationship that happens when a relationship ends. There will be grieving for the person, and for the relationship with that person. That is what has to be processed in order to move on.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] That makes sense; you care about him so you miss him. This is one of those things that will take time. Accepting and acknowledging the emotions, even when they are painful, will let the emotions evolve and over time they will become less painful.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, it must be a painful experience. The end of a relationship is a loss, and there is a grieving process to go through. That is a painful experience.

  "[Questions] Have you tried talking to her about it?",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Have you tried seperating from her?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] That's so hurtful. Do others feel the same as you?",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Maybe you can try talking to yoru manager next time it happens?",

  "[Self-disclosure] Of course!! managers are erally helpful. I had a similar sitation with a coworker two years ago and the head of my group really helped me clear it up.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] I tried really hard not to let her get to me. Which was really hard but doable.",
  "[Reflection of feelings] Exactly!!!!",
  "[Self-disclosure] a few months",

  "[Questions] Someone else would have collapsed already. Do you go outside a lot?",
  "[Other] Maybe that's why your depression got worse. We need the sun and fresh air to feel better",

  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] That is really hard but i think you can be successful.",
  "[Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you are overwhelmed and want to come up with a plan to move forward.",
  "[Self-disclosure] When i was in school, we started study groups. They were so helpful and encouraging to each other. Are there any study groups available?",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] I see that covid-19 really changes the way we do things. Is it possible to do a zoom study group or facetime with friends?",
  "[Questions] Do you have other concerns?",
  "[Reflection of feelings] I can see from chatting with you that this is a major stressor for anyone to undertake.",
  "[Self-disclosure] I can see where that is a stressor. I had to repeat a class once and pay for the housing, classes, and financial aspects. But, i did pass the next time and was able to make a difference in peoples' lives with my career. Sometimes the stressors and challenges are part of the end goal which is even bigger to humanity.",

  "[Self-disclosure] I have been in toxic relationships before and to be honest it does sound a little as though this is one of those situations.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Do you feel that perhaps it might be time to move on? People who will cheat twice are pretty unlikely to ever change their ways.",

  "[Self-disclosure] Yes i have. My sister in law was diagnosed with cervical cancer and i wanted to be supportive but i had no real idea what to say.",
  "[Information] I actually talked to a counsellor about it. I think that you should do that, it might help you a lot.",

  "[Providing Suggestions] Gotcha so not only are you frustrated with what he is doing, but you are also worried about his reputation! First of all, can i ask if he is just your friend online or if you hangout with him in person too?",
  "[Other] Okay i see. From personal experience, the best way to confront someone who likes to do most of their confrontations online, is in person. Since he is so used to almost \"hiding\" behind a screen, his feelings will be more vulnerable and real if you discuss your concerns in person.",
  "[Information] A suggestion i would make would be to hangout with him in person, and bring up the issues that you and your friends have been seeing. But it's important to not make him feel overwhelmed. Almost like he is being \"ganged up on.\"",
  "[Reflection of feelings] I can tell that you care about this person as a friend, but you are worried that the way he thinks and talks may ruin that in a way. Make sure to let him know these concerns! It will show him that you guys truly are doing it out of love.",
  "[Self-disclosure] And yes i have actually had a very similar experience! Let me explain",
  "[Self-disclosure] One of my best friend's and roommate, had a very hard time separating friendship and roommate issues. It caused a lot of issues in the relationships with our friends. She had a tendency to discuss issues over text and didn't like doing it in person. But we realized, the problem with that is that you can't tell the emotion behind messages on a screen. But once we talked in person, our issues were solved because we could hear the intended emotions behind what we were saying",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Yes exactly. It sounds like he might have other reasonings behind his actions. And you guys talking to him as friends in person, would show him that you care and that he is in a safe environment. He doesn't need to be so extreme",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes of course! I wish you the best in overcoming this hard time with your friend. I believe that you guys will be able to talk through it since it's a newer issue. :)",

  "[Self-disclosure] I would have wanted a second chance too if i were in your shoes.",
  "[Questions] Is this affecting you really bad?",
  "[Information] If your mood is affecting your daily activities, normally that means your mental health has been affected.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] You could always talk to a professional if it's hard for you.",
  "[Self-disclosure] It is. But trust me, it really helps. I've been seeing a therapist recently actually and i love it. I don't have to worry about judgement at all.",
  "[Information] It's a hard step but worth it in the end.",
  "[Information] The job of the therapist isn't to figure out if what you did was wrong or right. It's to help you understand your feelings and better cope. That's why they are so great!",

  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I can relate. This whole year has been a mess.",
  "[Questions] Do you think you're staying away from people because you're supposed to or you're afraid of getting sick?",

  "[Other] It really isn't. That's such a hard situation to be in. I really can't think of much of a solution unfortunately.",

  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds to me like you have been working hard to support your life with you partner. They should respect that.",
  "[Questions] Is this a relationship you would want back if you could get it back?",

  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] New jobs and roles are always cause for anxiety. Just being concerned shows what a good employee you are. I think they are lucky to have you!",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Honestly, i from my own experience, which doesn't include management, i think it's all about the approach. As long as you are not negative and don't sound like you are complaining or telling them how to do their jobs you should be fine!",
  "[Providing Suggestions] I would start with an email. This is just my opinion, but with how busy they must be getting people up to speed with training, an email is always a great place to start.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Have confidence in yourself as well! Chances are, others are struggling too.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Again, at the risk of being repetitive, it's all about the tone! I recently underwent group training. It was online since we are all working virtually. There were a couple of \"whiners and know-it-alls\" and you could tell from the start. You don't seem that way at all!",

  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I'm sure it is hard to express how you feel with it being a short relationship, people may not understand. But sometimes we can feel such a strong connection and have faith in people very fast.",
  "[Reflection of feelings] I understand feeling connected to someone you've only known for a short amount of time. I'm sure you feel like you wont be able to let your guard down again anytime soon.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Maybe this could be a learning experience? I always try to see the best in people, but have learned to let people earn my trust. Not just get it for free.",

  "[Questions] Do you enjoy your job? What are some of your achievements?",

  "[Providing Suggestions] Some people express their frustrations in certain ways. Do you think there is another way to communicate with them? It's also okay to stand up for yourself and stand by what you feel is right.",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you're finding it hard to balance the isolation you feel during this pandemic, while you know it's the safest option, with the social gatherings your friends are having. Does that sound right?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] that is such a hard position to be in. it sounds like you are doing your best by choosing to be safe and keep your distance.",
  "[Self-disclosure] I have found that having vitural movie nights, or going on socially distanced walks with my pals has been so helpful with staying connected. Is this something you think your friends would be willing to try?",
  "[Information] I think a lot of people are going by the notion that you can't live your life in fear, and that they're going to have these big family gathering regardless of what is happening with covid. The stats have shown that after holidays the cases have surged, for example, memorial day, 4th of july, labor day. But i think its important to remember the bigger picture that peoples lives are literally at stake and the people that disregard need to be more aware.",
  "[Other] Can you tell them that that just isn't the case? You and your husband are making the right choice by staying home for the safety of yourselves and others. If i am correct, it has nothing to do with the fact that you don't want to see your pals and family!",
  "[Reflection of feelings] From chatting with you it sounds like your relationships with these people is incredibly important to you.",
  "[Other] I hope your friends can see how important they are to you and thats a huge reason why you're not seeing them.",
  "[Self-disclosure] I know a lot of people that think the same thing. I have one friend who thought that, and they ended up contracting covid. Thankfully she was ok, but after she got it she definitely didn't think it was a hoax anymore. I hope they understand the risk they are taking.",
  "[Other] I am proud of the choices you are making and i hope you can take some comfort in knowing that you are doing your part in helping keep things under control. There is a strength in numbers and the more people who understand that the faster it can be controlled.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes of course, i hope this was helpful. You are doing the best you can and take pride in knowing that. :)",

  "[Reflection of feelings] I am so sorry to hear that. I understand, things can be tough sometimes.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Have you reached out to people who may be feeling the same? I know that has helped me when i have felt down. It is not easy, i know, but sometimes taking a small step can make all the difference",
  "[Questions] I understand. Do you want to tell me more about what has been on your mind?",
  "[Self-disclosure] I really do understand. It is very strong and brave of you to speak up. I have suffered depression myself in the past and one thing that truly helped was going to see my doctor and talking it though with him. He suggested medication and after some trial and error i found one that worked. You must be so strong to have dealt with the way you are feeling for so long. Please know there is help out there. I know from experience. You are a person of worth.",

  "[Providing Suggestions] I recommend searching online about meditation , also one of thing that helped the most for me was exercise and eating healthy.",

  "[Providing Suggestions] Of course , for example i watched youtube videos of someone called theanxietyguy and i made tremendous progress with him. Also i drink teas to calm my nerves .",
  "[Self-disclosure] Somethings its want to come back but i am on top of it and always being discipline with myself. I make sure to love myself first and give myself priority.",
  "[Other] You are welcomed i am glad i was able to help out. Stay positive and healthy.",
  "[Information] I drink a lot of chamomile tea with honey which has a great flavor good to calm done, i drink mint tea very refreshing and tilo tea which helps me sleep.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Yes of course. If you worried about some kind of sickness i would recommend you go to the doctor get yourself a full checkup it will help calm you mind down and reassure you that you are healthy.",

  "[Providing Suggestions] I have been chatting with many students and you're not alone in the way your feeling, many students are expressing uncertainty in how they will perform in this round of finals due to covid. The best course of action is to try your best, you may surprise yourself.",

  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Give it a try, if its not for you at least now you know what doesn't work.",
  "[Self-disclosure] I often found myself anxious before finals, i found that often the build up to the exam was far worse and usually the exam was much easier than i had built it up to be in my head.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] That is true",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] That's a very understandable worry to have, and i'm sorry you're dealing with that right now.",
  "[Questions] Is there a specific path or event in the future that you are worried about?",
  "[Reflection of feelings] Things are very uncertain these days. I certainly have never experienced anything like it.",
  "[Self-disclosure] Personally, i have tried to lessen my anxiety by limiting my intake of news and social media. No matter what one might believe, there's always someone out there that's apparently going to take it to an extreme, and reading over and over about that is emotionally exhausting.",
  "[Reflection of feelings] Or constantly terrified.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] We can't control the world, or even another person really, but we can control ourselves.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Well, i don't try to deny the seriousness of the situation at all. But i do try to keep myself and my family healthy, physically and mentally, and maintain my close friendships via text/video.",
  "[Self-disclosure] And i schedule my day, even though i'm working and going to school from home. I schedule breaks to go out and enjoy the fresh air, dance like an idiot to some music, play with my dogs, or whatever is refreshing.",
  "[Other] A routine has been really really helpful. I also make sure to get plenty of sunshine. As the winter comes in, we have shorter days and it feels suffocating.",
  "[Reflection of feelings] That must be frustrating. I've learned there are just some people i can't trust with my vulnerabilities.",
  "[Reflection of feelings] But again, you cannot control how they react, you can only control yourself. And that's not to say you can turn off your emotions or anything, but once you let go of the idea that you can control someone else to your liking, you will feel better. Less out of control. Because that's a lot of what is disturbing about the pandemic. We have zero control over it.",
  "[Other] Sure thing, i wish you luck, and thank you for the compliment :-)",
  "[Questions] I have been feeling a little low too. Would you like to tell me a bit about why you are disgusted with yourself?",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ah yes, this has been especially obvious during the pandemic hasn't it? Too many people not following the social distancing rules",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Do you feel that the pandemic has made you feel worse? Or have you felt like this for a long time?",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Well, it is a pretty significant issue this year :). Re obesity, have you considered doing something to raise awareness?",
  "[Reflection of feelings] So you feel as though there is no bright side - that everything is just artificial and superficial?",
  "[Other] I don't mean to sound twee but there are things out there in life that can be appreciated for free :)",
  "[Self-disclosure] I know what you mean about that. I know plenty of people who spend too much of their life working every hour and it leaves them no time to appreciate their money!",
  "[Other] People like that are irritating, certainly. I am not sure what the solution is, other than to ignore them.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, the fact that you can reflect on it indicates to me that you are probably not guilty. Most of those who do this are totally unaware.",
  "[Other] It has been really nice chatting to you and i hope that things go your way in 2021. You seem like good person :)",

  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] talking about it and i'm sorry to hear. expressing your feelings to someone can help relieve so of that emotion.",

  "[Providing Suggestions] yes it does. Time will heal all. try to keep your self occupied and mind busy with things to enjoy",

  "[Other] Merry christmas!",
  "[Questions] How can i help you today?",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] I hear you are having trouble figuring out which friends are really your friends and which ones aren't. Is that about right?",
  "[Questions] I understand that... Did something happen that makes you feel like that?",
  "[Questions] Is this a significant other?",
  "[Questions] Are they ignoring you?",
  "[Questions] Are you sure they are okay? Or not away with family for the holidays?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] That's no good what do you think the problem is?",
  "[Questions] Do you owe someone already?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] That can get in the way of a friendship sometimes, but i try not to get ahead of myself and jump the gun. They may have lost a phone or something may have come up...",
  "[Reflection of feelings] That very well could be... Are you working?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I see, have you tried for unemployment?",
  "[Providing Suggestions] I understand that. What if that is the case? You may need to talk to them and let them know how you feel about that.",
  "[Questions] How long has this been going on?",
  "[Providing Suggestions] I understand that, but if you want to get to a point that you feel better about it then you will have to speak to them.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Do you see them everyday?",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand that, are you able to go over there.",

  "[Providing Suggestions] Well that is about all that can be done and wait for them to come around...do you have any hobbies?",
  "[Providing Suggestions] I like to go on runs every morning. It helps to clear my mind and makes it easier to brush things off when they bother me.",

  "[Providing Suggestions] Maybe take a run in order to clear your mind.",
  "[Other] I'm sure they will come around.",
  "[Other] That may be a good idea. Good talk",
  "[Questions] to them and may find out that it was never anything against you",
  "[Self-disclosure] I sometimes get ahead of myself and try to figure out what is going on and thinking that it was something i did. You are right too. Covid has stressed everyone out to the max.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] It has been a crazy year i am glad that it is almost over.",
  "[Providing Suggestions] I'm sure it will. Is there anything else i can help you with today?",

  "[Questions] Do you know of some triggers that might cause this anxiety?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] That sounds like something that could cause anxiety. We all strive to be recognized for our hard work. Have you conversed with your boss?",

  "[Other] It's been my pleasure. I wish you good luck!",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Of course! It's always good to make a list before the meeting. List out your skillsets and how each of those skills provide value to the company. If you can demonstrate to your boss how you provide value to the company, it can give you confidence when taking the next step; asking for a promotion",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] It's normal to feel that way. As humans we fear rejection. It's not a pleasant feeling!",
  "[Questions] good. and you?",
  "[Other] Great. How may i assist you today?",
  "[Other] Great. How may i assist you today?",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Great talking to you too. I am sorry to hear that you are very worried. Why do you think you might lose your class? Are you not good at the subject?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like it is the problem of the professor. It is always good think about the worst case senario. If, if, you really fail the class, what will happen?",
  "[Questions] I see! I love your career goal. When i was a student, i visited my professor's room a lot. I did that for almost all classes. Some professors helped me a lot and gave me a lot of hint. Do you visit them as well?",
  "[Questions] I see! I love your career goal. When i was a student, i visited my professor's room a lot. I did that for almost all classes. Some professors helped me a lot and gave me a lot of hint. Do you visit them as well?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I can see that you have great passion and you've been making efforts. My school was in a small capital city and the professors were not occupied with other students at all.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Since you're good at actual clinical stuff, i think you can do well at the tests too. Maybe you need more time to prepare for the test?",
  "[Reflection of feelings] Those tests are tricky, then i would ask more than a few questions in the class before the test. Students need to know what exactly they need to study in order to pass the test. I don't think most professors will mind helping students prepare for the tests.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I am happy to help and i wish your great success in school and in your career.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] anytime, merry christmas",
  "[Reflection of feelings] I can definetely understand why. During this pandemic we have been more isolated than ever",
  "[Self-disclosure] It's not easy",
  "[Self-disclosure] It is more than reasonable to be frustrated with regards to that. I myself have not been able to visit my ill mother. She lives in another country, so it's especially difficult.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Exactly, the experience feels like it lacks the main connection we share with our loved ones. It is totally normal to want to be face to face instead.",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I agree with you, what used to be super-exciting activities now have a much more monotonous feeling.",

  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] nope. I am cool without man",
  "[Providing Suggestions] haha, smart, yes. No need to force yourself to forget about her.",

  "[Providing Suggestions] That's great, the computer skills will help out a lot. And the programs help with writing skills too.",
  "[Self-disclosure] Do you have anyone like a counselor you can consult with to help you make a decision? When i was in school, i developed a relationship with the counselor so i felt comfortable asking.",

  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] It's great that you are putting out applications elsewhere as well!",
  "[Questions] What makes you anxious about coming home late?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh i understand",
  "[Questions] Have you thought about other ways to get back home besides walking?",
  "[Providing Suggestions] If that would help you ease your anxiety, i think it would be a good solution to consider!",
  "[Questions] What makes you anxious about walking home late?",
  "[Self-disclosure] Oh i understand about the safety issues, i too cannot stand walking alone at night",
  "[Questions] How long have you been in this long-distance relationship?",
  "[Self-disclosure] I try to avoid walking and either ask someone to come and get me, or take an uber or the bus or my own car!",
  "[Providing Suggestions] That's good to consider! I think that if money is an issue right now, it will become easier as you get your paychecks and will feel less guilty about ubering home",
  "[Questions] For your relationship, you've known this person for a long time before you got together?",
  "[Other] I'm sorry, that's what i meant, affording it (language issues my bad)",
  "[Questions] Ok so you've known him for a long time, you two feel comfortable with communicating your feelings and worries together?",
  "[Questions] Ok that's great! Do you want to tell me more about the issues you are experiencing with him so we can understand a bit more the root of the stress?",
  "[Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ah, i get it. So what i'm understanding from this is that you feel helpless in this situation and that's what's making you anxious?",
  "[Questions] Can you tell me a little more about how this feeling of helplessness is affecting you personally?",
  "[Questions] Does it bring back memories of another time where you felt helpless or is this the first time you're feelling this way?",
  "[Reflection of feelings] Ok, so from what i understand is that this is the first time you've felt this and you are lost because you don't know how to act and react to this",
  "[Questions] Were you the one that offered to help in the first place?",
  "[Reflection of feelings] Well, i think it is very considerate of you to help him financially, but do you feel that this has put an enormous amount of strain and pressure on yourself as well?",
  "[Questions] Oh okay, so you wouldn't say that you're looking for a job to continue helping him financially?",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] Ok that's good to hear!",
  "[Reflection of feelings] From what i'm understanding, you're not only feeling anxious and pressure in your own personal life but you're heart is also wherever he is right now and living whatever stress and pressure he is living as well, and that is putting yourself in a very anxiety-provoking position",
  "[Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand that, especially given the current pandemic situation, it isn't easy at all",
  "[Questions] Are you guys facetiming or communicating at all other than by texts?",
  "[Other] I'm trying my best, thank you for the input!",
  "[Questions] Upset about leaving the apartment?",
  "[Questions] Or was there something else that happened that weekend?",
  "[Providing Suggestions] Have you guys thought about scheduling date nights through facetime?",
  "[Self-disclosure] I understand that completely, i can relate a lot",
  "[Providing Suggestions] If it makes any difference, my partner and i have been doing date nights where we would dress up, put make up on and do our hair and everything as if we were going to the restaurant, and even if it is through facetime or whenever we see each other in real life, it helps not only with our own self-esteem but also our relationship",

Are you able to communicate with a family member about your fear and stress?",
  "[Other] You are very welcome.",
