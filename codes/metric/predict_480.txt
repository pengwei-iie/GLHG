[Other] i think that is a really good idea!
[Reflection of feelings] it's ok. i understand what you are saying. i think that you are a good worker, but i would be upset too if i were you.
[Self-disclosure] i had a similar situation where i had been unable to pay my friend's bills for two years, so i was able to find a job myself.
[Reflection of feelings] that is really hard to do. i would have to say that i have never experienced such a situation.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] that is true. it is a very difficult situation to be in, especially with all of the people that are on your side.

[Questions] i am fine, thank you for asking. what is bothering you? can you tell me a little about yourself?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] ah, ok. that makes sense.
[Self-disclosure] i can see how you are feeling. sometimes we are not supposed to speak in absolutes. you are not the one who should have to do the work.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i can see why your manager did that to you. it is a very stressful situation to be in and i know how hard that is to have to be with two people quit during a holiday.
[Reflection of feelings] i can tell that you are trying to keep your boss from doing anything that would upset you, so you have not done that to yourself.
[Reflection of feelings] i understand how you are feeling about this. this pandemics the world at large and you are not the only one that is affected by this panpandemia.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i am sure they will understand. you are a strong person. i wish you all the best.
[Self-disclosure] i have had many situations like this and it can be very difficult to help someone who is struggling.
[Questions] have you talked to her about it?
[Other] i wish you the best. take care.
[Other] you too!
[Questions] hello. how are you today?
[Questions] hello, how are you today?
[Questions] i am sorry to hear that. what is going on with you?
[Questions] that's a lot of work. do you feel that you are not working enough?
[Providing Suggestions] have you tried to talk to your doctor or therapist? they are usually able to help you with your issues.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i understand that... i have been working in retail for the past year and my kids are still in school. i wish you all the best.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i understand that. do you feel like you are not doing enough in your study?
[Questions] do you have any hobbies or interests that you enjoy doing?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i understand you are worried about losing your job. do you want to see if there is any change?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] you are not alone! i am glad to hear that you are taking care of your family and helping them.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i think you are great for taking the time to learn how to do something that makes you happy.
[Questions] what are your favorite things to do?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] yes you get value time with our cjilild
[Affirmation and Reassurance] yes family time can be a blessing.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] you're welcome! have a wonderful rest of your day.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] you too!
[Other] you as well, good evening.
[Questions] i can understand that. have you tried reaching out to them to see if there is something in your life that you can help with?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] that is a very difficult thing to be honest. you sound very caring, and you are not getting stabbed. you are doing your best to be a good friend to yourself.
[Reflection of feelings] i can understand how that is frustrating.
[Providing Suggestions] maybe you should try reaching out to see if they would want to meet you there. if they wouldn't, it may not be a problem to reach out to them.
[Self-disclosure] i have been in a similar situation myself. i found that i was not able to find the right one at first but i started following a few different subs and found that my friends were more friendly than others. it was easier to find someone to talk to.
[Self-disclosure] i understand your feelings. i'm also a fan. i find that it'll make things easier to talk about when you have a connection. if they don't want to talk to you, they're not worth talking to.
[Questions] what is your favorite genre of anime?
[Providing Suggestions] i would suggest joining an online community or even a local university. you can also try to join local clubs if you are able to.
[Self-disclosure] i have been in a club before, and i know that if you do join one you can see the people who are there. they are also great for connecting with others and sharing your feelings.
[Self-disclosure] i know that can be difficult, but it is definitely worth it. it is a great way to connect with others and keep your mind off of the unknown.
[Self-disclosure] i understand your concern about that. it's very difficult to find someone who you're close to. do you have any friends or family who you can talk to?
[Other] i hope you will be lucky!
[Affirmation and Reassurance] yes, just go ahead and do that! you will have a great time!
[Reflection of feelings] i understand how that would be hard for you to do. but i know that you are worth it! it is not about whether or not you are overthinking it, but about your friends. you are important to them.
[Questions] is there anything that you'd like to talk about?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] so what're you feeling now?
[Reflection of feelings] that sounds like a lot of work, and it's not fair to everyone. it'd be better if you did it without talking about it.
[Reflection of feelings] i completely understand. i have been there myself. i would love to talk about it but i don't know if i could ever get it to work.
[Providing Suggestions] have you considered talking to anyone about it?
[Reflection of feelings] it sounds like that is a very difficult time to be in and out of work. what else do you like to do?
[Self-disclosure] i feel depressed a lot, but that's not really a reflection on me.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] that sounds like a great idea. i would definitely recommend that for yourself.
[Other] thank you. i hope you have a wonderful christmas!
[Questions] hello, how are you doing today?
[Questions] what's causing you to be anxious?
[Questions] do you feel as though you are not able to see your surroundings or the situation at large enough?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] well, if you have a job that can support you, maybe you can take a few of those options to help with the stress.
[Self-disclosure] i'm glad i could help! i'd love to hear anything else you'd like to share.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] that's great to hear, thank you for reaching out.
[Providing Suggestions] i'm glad i could help.
[Self-disclosure] i have had a similar situation happen to me before. i have to be prepared for the worst.
[Reflection of feelings] i am sorry to hear that, i hope that you are not being too harsh about this.
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] it sounds like you have been laid off due to pandemics. have you thought about looking for another job?
[Questions] what is causing you to be stressed?
[Providing Suggestions] i understand how you feel about that. it is difficult when you are in a bad spot during a stressful time. have you ever tried to explain to your advisor why this is happening?
[Other] i would say to take it as soon as possible and try not too hard on yourself.
[Other] i think that's a good idea. you will be more distracted with your family than your studies!
[Self-disclosure] i can understand why you are feeling that way. do you have anyone that you can talk to about this?
[Questions] do you feel that you are struggling enough that you can't make it through this difficult time?
[Providing Suggestions] i would definitely talk to your parents about it, and let them know that you are feeling down and don't want to give up on yourself.
[Providing Suggestions] i think you can start by expressing your concerns in a calm way. this way, they are not aware that you are upset with them.
[Reflection of feelings] well, there is nothing to worry about. you are not the only one. you have made a choice and you are happy with it.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] oh wow, that's a big deal. it's amazing to see how close people are.
[Reflection of feelings] that would be a great idea!
[Questions] hello, how are you doing today?
[Questions] hello. how are you doing today? please tell me more about you.
[Questions] that sounds very exciting! i am so happy to hear that! is there anyone you might want to talk to about this?
[Reflection of feelings] i understand how you feel, i have been in similar shoes before.
[Questions] would you consider staying in your home for a while?
[Self-disclosure] i would definitely consider it if i were able to.
[Reflection of feelings] yes, i would. it's not the most common thing but i have had friends who did.
[Providing Suggestions] maybe you should try to find a job as a retail worker.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] well, i'm sure that if you did that, you would feel a lot better about yourself.
[Reflection of feelings] i think you are right, that they would not have a choice in how far you are from them. you are very lucky to have someone you can talk to about it.
[Reflection of feelings] i understand your feelings and i can understand why you feel like you might not be able to get the job. however, i believe that you should not feel ashamed for taking the job just because you have had it before. you should try not to be ashamed of yourself.
[Reflection of feelings] i can understand that you are feeling upset about the job situation, but i think you have a lot of responsibility to take control of yourself. i know it's tough right now but i hope you can find a way to get through this.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i can understand that. it sounds like you are worried about what is going to happen.
[Reflection of feelings] i think that you can do it!
[Providing Suggestions] you might want to take some time for yourself to think about this. perhaps you could talk about it to your dad and see if there is anything that might help.
[Reflection of feelings] that is really good that you are seeing her and that your happiness has been noticed.
[Self-disclosure] yes, but she might also be feeling more stressed out about her family's financial situation than you.
[Reflection of feelings] it is okay to feel sad sometimes but i think that we should be happy because we are all human.
[Other] i hope you can help me with something that i can help you with.
[Other] you are doing the best you can.
[Other] you are very welcome.
[Providing Suggestions] you can try not to make friends wigh someone you don't know.
[Questions] do you know if she has been able to see your kids or not?
[Other] i understand, you have had a similar situation before.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] she probably just wants the attention and you dont know for sure.
[Reflection of feelings] well, maybe you can talk about your reasons for putting her second.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] well, if she doesn't understand that, then she probably doesn'tknow how to have a good conversation.
[Self-disclosure] i understand that. i have had twins myself. it was a very difficult time for me too.
[Providing Suggestions] if she wants to be around you, then she has to be there for you. i am sure you can find someone that will support you if you talk about it.
[Providing Suggestions] try to speak with her about the situation and then you can share what you want to talk about.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i understand how frustrating that feeling, but you have to keep your head up, and you have every right to be scared to say no.
[Providing Suggestions] i think you should try to have a conversation with her about how she feels. it might help a lot.
[Other] you are welcome.
[Other] you too, you too!
[Questions] what is causing your stress?
[Questions] what is it about that that you are stressed about?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] well, that's an understandable cause. what is her motivation for intimidation?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i understand. i had a professor who did that to me.
[Questions] what was your sticker?
[Reflection of feelings] i know it's hard to deal with sometimes, but if you're ever looking for ways to do better, i would recommend taking a survey for your class. that way, you can have some time to study the class, and not have to worry about how much money you make.
[Other] oh my goodness, that's amazing! i love that movie! i have no idea what i'm going to do, i'll make myself look silly.
[Other] you've got this, my friend.
[Other] you're welcome! i hope you feel better soon.
[Other] you are welcome!
[Questions] hello! how are you today?
[Questions] hi how are you doing today?
[Questions] i'm sorry to hear that, that must be hard to go through. why is it that you feel upset?
[Questions] was it a breakup with someone else?
[Reflection of feelings] that sounds terrible, especially since you were close to her
[Reflection of feelings] i am sorry to hear that. what happened?
[Reflection of feelings] thats really sad, you should not let this happen to you
[Reflection of feelings] it's really difficult to lose someone you love
[Reflection of feelings] well that is understandable. i remember how upset i was about my friend ending our relationship.
[Providing Suggestions] what happened?
[Reflection of feelings] i understand how you feel.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] it is very difficult to get through, but it is a very good thing that you are trying to find the courage to do it.
[Self-disclosure] i know that is a tough time but you are an adult and you have a right to be upset and angry with your parents.
[Providing Suggestions] don't let the emotions control you
[Self-disclosure] i am in my 30s and we had a mutual friend who was married.
[Reflection of feelings] it is great that you are going through the process

[Self-disclosure] i was in your shoes too, and i know how difficult that must be.
[Providing Suggestions] yes, i think that if you keep your head up and keep your mind off of it, you'll be able to make it through this.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] that's not good, but you're not alone in feeling this way. you deserve to be happy, that you have someone to support you in your life.
[Reflection of feelings] i understand that you can do things to help you through this and you don't have to wait forever for the help you can need, but you don ; t have time for yourself to be around her.
[Self-disclosure] i had a similar situation where my husband left me and i went to my home and got to see him. i was really upset and didn't know what to do. i went out for a drink and it was a lot better than i would have ever expected.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i can understand that. i know how difficult that can be. i had the same problem when i was in college. it is not easy. but it definitely does help to think outside of the house and do not let the outside make up for what you are doing.
[Other] you're welcome. i hope you will find a way through this.
[Questions] i know it sounds crazy, but just try not to give up on yourself. i know you will get through this.
[Other] thanks for talking!
[Questions] hello, how are you today?

[Questions] that sounds difficult. is it possible you have some form of mental health issues?

[Reflection of feelings] yes, i think you would have a great time. i think that you are very intelligent and i think it would be a great idea for you to reach out.
[Self-disclosure] i have had a similar situation before. i was in a relationship with someone who wasn't the best at communicating. i would have been upset about him being in the relationship. he would have said that he was depressed and i would be sad. he told me to take a deep breathe and that it was okay to be upset and i was happy. i also would feel really bad because i wasn'thing i was doing wrong, but he was still there and we were still friends.
[Reflection of feelings] i understand that your feelings are understandable. i hope i have been able to help you.
[Self-disclosure] i can see that. you are being very anxious and anxious about the situation, but have you tried reaching out to other parents who may be dealing with these feelings?

[Reflection of feelings] i'm so sorry to here about that. that is a terrible thing to go through. i can understand that you are feeling sad and sad.
[Questions] so he's your friend now?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] well that is not a problem. if he does not want a true relationship with someone then he should be allowed to say he does want one but he does have to say that he does.
[Reflection of feelings] i'm sure he will love you, but he has to get over this.
[Other] i understand that. it's hard to get over someone who we don't know or care about.
[Reflection of feelings] i can understand how you feel. sometimes we don't know the truth and it can make us feel sad.
[Reflection of feelings] that's tough. i'm sure you are not alone in this.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] that sounds like a good idea, i am sorry to hear that.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] oh i see. well, if you are in a relationship with your therapist, you might be able to find a way to get in touch with her.
[Other] that is understandable.
[Reflection of feelings] that makes sense, i think you should be able to move on from this situation as you know.

[Reflection of feelings] i am sure you are not the only one struggling. do they have a support system or do they offer a support plan?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i think it is okay to be sad about the breakup. it is not ok to feel sad for the reason that you are sad.

[Providing Suggestions] do you have any friends you can talk to about this?

[Other] i am doing well. how are things with you?

[Affirmation and Reassurance] that is really hard to do. what i would suggest is to find a hobby or do a hobby that is a hobby you enjoy and maybe a hobby for yourself or friends
[Affirmation and Reassurance] you did not have a wrong break up, that is a terrible thing to do.
[Questions] did he get jealous of you?
[Questions] are you feeling lonely?
[Reflection of feelings] it is very difficult to not have a relationship with someone who you had feelings for.
[Reflection of feelings] it's not right to think that you were not able to tell him about the relationship. it'd be a terrible thing to do.
[Providing Suggestions] is there anything else that might help you to find out the truth?
[Questions] is he still with you?
[Reflection of feelings] you are not alone. my mother has been through the same thing.

[Questions] have you been able to work for your job during the panderic?
[Self-disclosure] i can relate to that. i have also been struggling in that situation. have you thought about looking for other work?
[Other] i am glad i was able to help you. i hope you can find something soon.
[Providing Suggestions] also, when i am unemployed, i find that it can be very helpful to be able to work with others.
[Providing Suggestions] you are not alone in feeling bad about the situation.

[Questions] what's going on?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i'm sorry to hear that. what's the problem?
[Reflection of feelings] i can understand why you are upset with her, but you have to accept that she is not doing her duty and she has to deal with this.
[Self-disclosure] i have been through that myself. i was in a similar situation when my dad got out of prison and my mom got out.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i understand that.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] that is not good
[Reflection of feelings] i would do it if you could.
[Reflection of feelings] i can see how annoying that would be. it sounds like you are very selfish.
[Questions] is it possible to talk to her about this?
[Providing Suggestions] sometimes people are just born with an issue, and that's normal to feel that way.
[Reflection of feelings] i can understand how you must feel.
[Providing Suggestions] you have a lot of time and energy to do things that you love the most. you should spend it doing those things.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] you are right, not many people have a place in their lives that is able to support themselves.
[Providing Suggestions] you should try to talk to her about it. maybe you can get some advice from her?
[Questions] is there any way you can talk to her about her behavior?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] that is really difficult. what about you that you have to ask these questions?
[Reflection of feelings] it sounds like you are really concerned about her health.
[Providing Suggestions] if you do not feel comfortable with her boundaries, you can try talking to a professional about it and getting her to see a therapist
[Affirmation and Reassurance] you should talk to her and try to explain to her that you do not want to get into the same relationship.
[Reflection of feelings] it's tough, but you have to try to move on from this situation.
[Reflection of feelings] i'm sorry to hear that. it sounds like you have a good girlfriend.

[Self-disclosure] i had a similar situation happen when i was a teenager. i found out my friend, a friend, had been cheating on me, and then my friend went on to break up with me. i never felt any way towards him, but it made me feel awful. i just wanted to be alone and i felt like he was cheating on his wife.
[Reflection of feelings] i can understand why that would be frustrating for you. i also think that you should try to be patient and listen to your friends about what is going on.
[Providing Suggestions] sometimes we need to sit down and talk about what is going on. i would start with talking to your friends about how this is affecting your life and how it has affected your relationships.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] it sounds like your friends are very toxic. do you think this is a case of someone who is in the wrong?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i can definitely understand how frustrating it is to have someone treat you badly.

[Providing Suggestions] maybe try and get some of the money from the charity you are looking to help.
[Reflection of feelings] i am so sorry to here that, i can understand how you are feeling right now.
[Providing Suggestions] i would suggest a financial advisor or someone who has been through similar situations and has dealt with the same situation. it sounds like you are having a hard time with the situation, but i think you can use a counselor.
[Providing Suggestions] i understand that. i am so sorry. i know it is hard to make a choice about your financial situation.
[Providing Suggestions] have you tried talking to a supervisor or someone that knows about covid?
[Questions] that is a very good idea. i think that is what you will find out soon enough.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i understand that you are trying to make sure you do not have to pay for food. you should not be taking advantage of someone else's ability to pay you for your services.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] that sounds like a great idea. it will help you focus on your job and make you less overwhelmed
[Other] you are not alone! i have had a lot of trauma in my life too, and i know how it feels.
[Questions] have you tried talking to anyone about it?
[Questions] are you married?
[Providing Suggestions] have you thought about seeing a professional for help?
[Questions] hi, how are you today?
[Questions] oh no, i am so sorry to hear that. that must be frustrating to be having to go through the same thing.
[Reflection of feelings] i can definitely relate to that. it'd be nice to have something to do with my job, but i know the feeling of being overwhelmed. i understand that you are stressed about your job, and i understand how stressful it must be to be at work.
[Providing Suggestions] do you have a job that involves a lot of coping and communication?
[Reflection of feelings] i understand how frustrating that can be, especially when the work load is so heavy.
[Reflection of feelings] i can understand how frustrating that would be, but i think you are doing a great job at not having to deal with that!
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i can definitely understand that. i have found that when i switch jobs, i can get a better understanding of what is going on in my life.
[Questions] do you have any experience working in the field that you would like to get back into?
[Other] it'd be great to hear from someone who has been through similar things.
[Providing Suggestions] that is good that you reached out to other people in your area. i am sure that you will find a job soon.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] yes, it is. but it is worth it for the support and for you to try to see if you can get through this.
[Questions] have you thought about seeing a therapist who might be able to help with some of your issues? there are many different therapists out there and it's not impossible to find a job with free therapy.
[Questions] what's your current situation at the moment?
[Self-disclosure] it is important to get your mental well being out of the question. i would suggest that if you are feeling like this, you need to seek out some professional help.
[Self-disclosure] i had a similar problem when i was working in a grocery store. it was very difficult to find the tools to do my work in a reasonable time frame.
[Other] thank you for sharing.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] you are very welcome!
[Questions] hi, how are you today?
[Questions] what is causing you to be angry?
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] oh no, that's really not fair of her. i'd be upset too, but i would be willing to bet that she didn't mean to do that.

[Affirmation and Reassurance] that is very hard. i am sorry that you have to deal with that.
[Questions] do you feel that you are not being able to support yourself financially?

[Affirmation and Reassurance] that's wonderful! you sound like you have a great spirit. do you have any hobbyists that you can talk to about the emotions and feelings of depression?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i have heard of that before. i have also heard of meditation that has a positive effect on the body and mind. have they done anything like that before?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] that is a great idea. you are very welcome!
[Reflection of feelings] i am sorry to hear that. i understand how you feel.
[Reflection of feelings] i can understand that. i would feel the same way about losing my parents.
[Other] i am glad to hear that. you can use this time to take a break from your loved ones.
[Reflection of feelings] it is okay. i am glad i could help you and have a good day!
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i understand, it is hard when you are not able to make effort to make new friends and that is why i think you should not feel ashamed about not reaching out.
[Providing Suggestions] i see. that is a difficult situation to be in.
[Questions] i understand. that is the hard part for me too. i do not take enough free time for me to get my life back on track.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] yes, you should accept that. i think it's a really good thing that you have not had to talk to someone in the past.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i think you are right. it is important to be honest with yourself. i would do the same and do the best you can.
[Providing Suggestions] that sounds like a great idea. you can't have everything, but you have to try to reach out for some support from other people who are having the same experience.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] that's wonderful. i wish you all the best.
[Other] merry christmas. i hope i could help you with anything.

[Reflection of feelings] that's really hard to hear. have you tried talking to her about this?
[Providing Suggestions] have you tried to talk to her about the feelings she had before the breakup?
[Reflection of feelings] it'll be okay. just remember that it'd not be the end of the world. you will find someone. i know you are worth the wait.
[Providing Suggestions] have you thought about finding some hobby or hobbyactivities that will help you with your feelings for a while?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i understand. but you are not a burden to her. you are her best friend.
[Providing Suggestions] do you think that she was feeling a bit unempathize?
[Questions] what would be the first step?
[Reflection of feelings] that sounds like a really hard situation to be in. do you think that would make you feel better about her?
[Providing Suggestions] sometimes it is best to make sure you are not putting too much stress on yourself. sometimes it helps to know that she has her reasons for doing something like this.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] if she does not want to fight about this, then you don't need to.
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] i'm sorry to hear that. i've been feeling really down lately. what is bothering you? i hope i can help.
[Questions] what happened?
[Questions] what've been furing you?
[Providing Suggestions] have you considered talking to a counselling or a therapist about how you feel about your situation?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i see. i have also found a job in the past. i was able to find a job while at the same time not working from home. i also found another job after my current position was approved.
[Reflection of feelings] i understand. i have been in a similar situation. it'll be ok, it will all be okay.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i don't have any mask to mask me with, so i'm really not allowed to have a mask on. it'd be easier for me to mask myself with mask company, but not others.
[Providing Suggestions] have you considered looking for a job somewhere else?
[Questions] are you working on a resume or a job?
[Self-disclosure] yes, it is very sad.
[Providing Suggestions] have you looked into any job postings at the local grocery store?

[Affirmation and Reassurance] you are very welcome! i've been there before, and it'll always be a blessing.
[Questions] how long have you been on this road?
[Questions] i am fine, how about you? what are you doing today?
[Other] i'd recommend breaking up with your boyfriend if you feel that you should not. do you feel like you might be in the wrong place for that?
[Providing Suggestions] have you thought about getting a divorce?
[Questions] have you tried talking to him about this?
[Questions] what if he did not do anything, you just don'; t know?
[Reflection of feelings] i understand your feelings. but you are not a friend, you are a person. you are human.
[Reflection of feelings] i think you have a problem with how you are handling this. i would be very upset if i was in your shoes.
[Providing Suggestions] maybe you should talk to him about it and then see if he will understand, i know it is tough, but i think that would be a great idea.
[Other] i think that's totally understandable. you're both guilty of what he's doing and you need to talk about it.
[Providing Suggestions] do you think that if you were to tell him, he would not have to be as disgusted with her?
[Self-disclosure] yes, you should. you have to be strong. i think you are strong for you and deserve better than that.
[Other] it sounds like you are trying to do the right thing by staying in your marriage, and that is not good for you.
[Questions] no, i'm not here. can you tell me more about it?
[Reflection of feelings] i am so sorry to here about that. i am here to listen if you want to talk about it?

[Affirmation and Reassurance] you are not alone in feeling this way.
[Providing Suggestions] maybe you should try a hobby. maybe take a walk in the park, or a park. maybe read a book, or do something outdoors. maybe go to a movie or a movie night. i would try to explore nature, and explore nature.
[Providing Suggestions] have you tried talking to your friends and family?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i understand. it is a tough situation, but i think that you have a great attitude.
[Reflection of feelings] i understand. i would definitely go out and see if there is any other people around that you could meet.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i know, i know. it's a very tough situation to be in. i have no doubt that you are going to find a way to move forward in life with your family.
[Questions] do you have any family or friends that you can talk to about this?
[Questions] do you have any hobbies that would help you?
[Self-disclosure] i have a couple of sharks myself. they're very smart and love to eat other fish too.
[Questions] no, but i have had some similar feelings and i know how stressful it can be.
[Questions] that is really cool, that is one of the most amazing things i have heard.
[Other] that's really interesting, i never realized that it was possible to have an encounter with a person who had a different type of personality than mine!
[Providing Suggestions] i think you can make it through this if you really want.
[Reflection of feelings] i've had someone who i was extremely invested in get out and it made me feel less guilty. it is hard to see someone fall for you when you are not in their life. it seems like you have a good sense of self respect and trust that you will not let this happen again.
[Self-disclosure] i have experienced something similar. it was really hard for me to connect with someone who i didn't know until i had been married. i felt like we were in a different world than we were. i was very hurt when i found out that he was cheating on me. i understand that it is difficult to move on from someone who is cheating.
[Reflection of feelings] i understand how you feel. i know that you can do this.
[Self-disclosure] i have found that having someone who can take care of me helps me get through these tough times.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i do know what you mean, but i think you have to find the right one for yourself. you don'want a situation where everyone else is treating you badly and you feel guilty.
[Self-disclosure] it sounds like you are really upset about it.
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] i understand that you are not sure what the issue is with your relationship with her. i understand how you feel.
[Reflection of feelings] that sounds like a very difficult situation, especially since you have such a strong sense of pride in your partner. do not let this stress you out too much.
[Other] i understand. the media has a strong opinion on things. i think you are right though, that you are putting yourself at risk by seeing someone new.
[Other] i am not saying that. i am saying you have to be very careful, because the way you are saying it makes it sound like you are focusing on your wife.
[Questions] have you ever thought about talking to a professional about this? it might help you to not let this distract you from the fact that your husband is a jerk.
[Reflection of feelings] yes, that is the one. i've been married for eight years. we have been married ten.
[Providing Suggestions] you have to be yourself. you can not just be yourself and let others judge you. you should not judge others for their actions. you have been in love for many years and have found someone who you can share that love with.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] it's hard to think about, but you have to be willing to give up your life. you have no reason to not try. you are not a good enough person.
[Other] that was not my assumption. it was my suggestion.
[Questions] hi, how are you today?
[Questions] what is the problem?
[Questions] how are you feeling about your day?
[Reflection of feelings] i understand how that feels. i have been in a similar situation before. it is really hard when people are not interested in talking to you.
[Providing Suggestions] i have been in a similar situation and found it helpful to have some positive thoughts about a relationship. i also found that if someone is sad about something, they tend to focus on the negative aspects.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] you're not alone, i know that feeling. i've been in a similar situation myself.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i understand that, and it sounds like you have a great sense of your heart and know that you will not be disappointed.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i wish you the best of luck. and if you need anything else, i'd love to hear it. i know it's hard to get the answers you need, but i hope that you will find the right one!
[Reflection of feelings] well, then you're not the reason for the breakup. you'll find someone who will love you no matter what.
[Reflection of feelings] i know you are worried about that, but i think you are not the reason he didn't want to.
[Questions] how can you help me today??
[Questions] are you in college or a university?
[Questions] are you in college?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] if you would like, you can study online classes and do not worry about the exam.
[Providing Suggestions] have you tried looking into some local counselling? there are some free online courses to help you learn a little bit about yourself
[Providing Suggestions] i just wanted to say that you are not alone in this.
[Other] it is free and you can also download it for free or free
[Self-disclosure] i was in a similar situation. i didn't have the time or motivation for studying.
[Self-disclosure] i have a friend who lives in an apartment complex so he has a lot of free books that he uses
[Providing Suggestions] that is a good idea. it would give you some fresh air and fresh air.
[Self-disclosure] you are not a student and you can not pay it all

[Reflection of feelings] i understand, i am also betrayed. but i have been in a similar situation myself. i think it's time to move on and focus on yourself.
[Providing Suggestions] have you talked to a counselor about this?
[Reflection of feelings] that's really hard, especially with a relationship that long. i would have been upset if i was in your shoes.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i don t think you should have to wait until after this to know if something is going to happen. i would be extremely upset if i were you.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i can see how that can be hard to believe, especially given how long time has passed.
[Other] do you think you can tell him that you were together for years and that you didn't see him again?
[Self-disclosure] my husband was the sole winner. i didn't want to let him win though.
[Reflection of feelings] that's a really hard thing to do.
[Providing Suggestions] i would think it's probably more of a habit than a problem.
[Questions] what are your feelings about this?
[Other] that sounds very difficult. how are you feeling about this?
[Reflection of feelings] i know i was in a similar situation to you
[Reflection of feelings] i can understand your feelings. i had a similar situation myself and it helped me get through it.
[Providing Suggestions] it is important to understand that you have been through a lot, and this is a chance for you to move forward. you have every right to feel upset, but don'think about what you can do to help him.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i know, it doesn't make things any better, but it will bring a little bit of light.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] you are very welcome! i hope you have a great rest of your day.
[Other] it's a great idea
[Other] i hope you are feeling better
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i am sorry to hear that. what was wrong with your day?
[Questions] i am sorry to here about this. is there anything that might be bothering you today?
[Reflection of feelings] that is a very difficult situation to be in.
[Self-disclosure] i have also been in a similar situation before. i love to spend time with my friends. we all love the same things.
[Self-disclosure] i find that movies are helpful in dealing with stress, but they can also help you focus on something else.
[Providing Suggestions] maybe you should try going out for a hike, it is a great way to clear the air and get your mind out of the house.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i am glad i could help!
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i understand, i know that you are not comfortable talking to anyone, so it is good that you feel comfortable talking with people.
[Questions] have you considered looking for a new job?
[Other] you are very welcome. i hope you feel better.
[Questions] hello! how are you today?
[Questions] no i'm not. i've been studying to help with my grades. are you doing anything?

[Providing Suggestions] have you been able to do anything about your fear?
[Questions] what are some of your hobbies you like to do?
[Questions] what's the cause of your pandemic?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] don't worry, it will pass soon.
[Providing Suggestions] have you thought about going to an activity that will help you get back into your normal routine?
[Providing Suggestions] have you considered reaching out to people who have been through similar situations?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] it's good that you have someone to talk to about this. it'll help to keep in touch with people who may be feeling the same way as you.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i'm sure you are very happy.
[Self-disclosure] i know how difficult it can be. i know that you are trying your best, but it is really hard.
[Providing Suggestions] i would say that it's not hard to find a hobby you enjoy. that is a great start!
[Questions] i am fine, thank you for asking. is there anything that's bothering you?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] don't forget about them. it's ok to be single.
[Questions] have you considered talking to your friend about it?
[Reflection of feelings] i completely understand. i have been in a similar situation. it'd be hard to find a partner who was not drama - free.
[Questions] do you feel that you are being too much for these guys?
[Self-disclosure] i think the only thing that can help is to keep yourself busy. you are very important to yourself and your relationship.
[Providing Suggestions] have you considered doing something that might help you out with your health?
[Providing Suggestions] i think it'd be a good idea to make sure that you've got the right person for you. you can't have someone who doesn't trust you enough to date you. i think that's completely normal. you'll find someone you enjoy, and it'll be okay to have someone you love who does the same.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i would definitely encourage you to look for a better man if you want to go forward with a relationship. it will be much better if you can find someone who will appreciate you.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i believe that it'll be okay to do it if they say it'd be ok to do so.

[Other] you are very welcome!
[Reflection of feelings] i never did, but i have done the same. i am going to study harder next semester.
[Questions] i can understand why you would fail. did you have to pass the test? if so, then you should feel proud of yourself!

[Questions] is there anything else you would like to talk about?
[Reflection of feelings] i am sure that was very difficult for you to fail.
[Questions] i understand, but that's okay! it'll happen, and you will be fine!
[Self-disclosure] i have also struggled with that myself. i found that exercising helped me.
[Other] that's awesome! i think you should try to be a bit more careful with your time, and keep yourself busy, especially in the short term.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i'm glad i could help!
[Reflection of feelings] you have been in my position before and can understand how stressful this is.
[Other] i hope you feel better soon, and thank you for talking with me

[Other] you are welcome.
[Questions] i am doing well. thank you. what are you doing today?
[Questions] are you having a time to talk?
[Questions] what happened to make you feel this way?
[Reflection of feelings] that's horrible, and i can't believe you did that.
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] it sounds like you have a lot of problems
[Affirmation and Reassurance] it's understandable. it'd be nice to be able to talk to someone who has been through this.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i would suggest talking to him again if possible.
[Providing Suggestions] it sounds like you are in a tough spot, and it might be time to talk to your family about it. maybe they can help with your anger?
[Questions] what happened?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] it's a difficult situation, but if you keep doing it, it will eventually get better.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] if you can, you can get out of that situation and move on with your life.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i'm glad that you were able to talk to me.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] that's great that you've been able to talk to your friends about it.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i see. are you in a position where you can recharge?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] that is not a lot of people.
[Questions] do you think that maybe your spouse is stressed about your job and perhaps you are not having the same problems you are?

[Providing Suggestions] have you tried to go to a movie or tv show to talk about your feelings?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] that is good to hear. you sound like you are doing the right thing by not having to work.
[Self-disclosure] i know exactly how you feel, i am struggling to find a job and trying to get out of my situation.
[Self-disclosure] i have been in that position myself. i also found that if i have a specific goal, i can get more out of it than if i just have a different one.
[Reflection of feelings] i understand. that's why i always try to avoid the negative thoughts of others. i find that it helps me to take a deep breath and think about the positive thoughts.
[Other] yeah, it's definitely not!
[Providing Suggestions] i think you should be able to work from home, which will give you the option to not be in a relationship with them.
[Other] i am sorry to hear that you are having problems with covvid. do you have other hobbies?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] that sounds really nice. it sounds like you are very busy. maybe you could try going to a picnic at a park and letting your friends go with you.
[Reflection of feelings] i think the best thing is just to do what you enjoy doing. don't be too hard on yourself, you are only in your 30s so you are not doing anything wrong!
[Self-disclosure] i have had this happen before. it is not easy, but i have found that if i am in the situation i always find a path forward. i just do not care what others think or what i can do. i have a good relationship with my boss.
[Providing Suggestions] you are right, it is very hard to see the light at this point. do you have any other hobbies?
[Other] you too!
[Other] you too! i hope you have a wonderful rest of your day too!

[Affirmation and Reassurance] i am sure that you will do well.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] that's understandable. what are your grades in the class?
[Self-disclosure] i have been in that situation before. it is difficult when you don'' t feel comfortable with the answers.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i'm glad to hear that. i've been in similar situations myself. i also have to get out of the way of my mistakes and take my time to reflect on the situation.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i know you can do it!

[Other] no problem. i hope you are able to get through this!
[Questions] do you have any other hobbies that you would like to talk about?
[Questions] that is a very interesting way to have your day off. do you feel that you are not doing enough work?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i can understand that. it feels like you have no friends. it is hard to get out of your comfort zone.
[Self-disclosure] i've never been out of the country myself. i'd love to travel to europe some day, but i don't know if that will happen.
[Providing Suggestions] i live alone too. i've never been out of the country.
[Providing Suggestions] it was through a friends group.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] that is very true. i have been doing that myself and it is helpful for me.
[Other] that's a good idea! i think that would be a great first step.
[Self-disclosure] i had a similar experience, and it was difficult for me too, but i found that when i did not feel comfortable, i could spend more time with my friends and family. it was a lot easier for me.
[Providing Suggestions] also, you can do a gift exchange at the local church. that way you don't have to be forced to go to church, and you don t have anyone who might know you well.
[Providing Suggestions] i would also try to find some local groups that offer community services.
[Other] you're welcome. i hope you can get through this.
[Providing Suggestions] do you have any hobbies that you enjoy? maybe spending time with your family or friends?
[Other] you too!
[Other] you too!!

[Reflection of feelings] well, it's not your fault. it'll be okay.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i understand that. i've been in a similar situation.
[Reflection of feelings] that's great. i have been in a similar situation. i was unemployed for 3 years.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] it is, but we all have to make it through this.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i understand. that must have been very difficult to see someone else get in a similar situation.
[Reflection of feelings] i can understand how hard that is to be in this time.
[Providing Suggestions] i understand that, especially since you are not sure how to get her to the right path.
[Reflection of feelings] i can understand how upset you are about this. it is definitely not for you to get involved with someone who is not your cup of tea.
[Providing Suggestions] you can ask her if she is willing to move to another state for the same reasons.
[Restatement or Paraphrasing] so, you have a home for your children, and she is living with you?
[Questions] is there anyone close you can talk to about it?
[Questions] are you sure you are not thinking of the right way to do that?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] ok, have a great day
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i do not, i don't have the time or energy to do that.
[Other] yes, that sounds like a great idea!
[Affirmation and Reassurance] that sounds like a great idea.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i can understand that. it's hard to be in a position where you can't make much of a difference in your life.
[Self-disclosure] i understand that you feel sad but also feeling as if your life is ending due to covid.
[Questions] would you say that you are experiencing stress from the pandy?
[Providing Suggestions] i would suggest finding a few minutes at a time and trying to be as calm as possible to get your mind off of the situation. you will definitely feel better, it will help you relax and relax your mind.
[Providing Suggestions] i have found that deep breathing helps me relax and help calm my anxiety.
[Self-disclosure] i think that is a great idea!
[Other] i know it is hard to understand, but i think it is also worth looking into. there are so many online websites that offer free apps for free that you can play games and watch movies. i always thought of making a game for my son that he could play all the time, but then i realized that the free app doesn't give him the ability to play anything else, and it also gives him time to read books, do video games, read, do movies, go out and have fun. i'm sure there are a lot of other options out there.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] of course! i hope you enjoy reading.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] you are welcome. thank you for sharing your experience with me. i am glad i could be of some help.
[Other] thank you! i hope that you're doing better than i've been doing.
[Questions] how are you today?

[Restatement or Paraphrasing] so your boss is being selfish and being selfish. that is a very bad thing.
[Other] i think that would be a great idea.
[Providing Suggestions] you have been there for 15 yrs and you have made a decent amount of money but this ton of work does not mean you deserve a raise. i think it's best to keep your options open.
[Providing Suggestions] maybe you can bring it to your supervisor. maybe he will be able to understand how you feel.
[Questions] what are some of the other suggestions you could use?
[Questions] what is the problem with having proof?
[Providing Suggestions] you can use this as a way to make it through the day, or you could talk to him directly about your problem and see if he will understand.
[Providing Suggestions] i would definitely try to talk to him about his situation.
[Other] i can understand your frustration. but, i think you are a caring person. i think that if you don'' t let him see the light of day, he will not understand why you are upset.
[Providing Suggestions] have you thought about talking to your friend about this? maybe you could try talking to him in a more calm way?
[Providing Suggestions] you can also try to talk to your friends or family about this.

[Affirmation and Reassurance] yes, that would be a great gift!

[Reflection of feelings] i'm sure that would be a great gift. i think that is a great idea.
[Questions] i love that idea!
[Providing Suggestions] do you have any friends you could play it with?
[Reflection of feelings] that'll be a lot of work. but it sounds like you're doing your best to do the best for your kids.

[Other] you are very welcome. i hope you have a wonderful holiday season.
[Other] how are you today

[Providing Suggestions] perhaps they just don't want to speak directly to you?
[Information] i understand that it can be difficult for someone to see the positives in someone. i have been in that situation myself, and i know how difficult it is for others to deal with their own feelings.
[Providing Suggestions] i would suggest taking a walk outside to clear your head, get a book or something, maybe a movie or tv show to get you to forget about these issues.

[Affirmation and Reassurance] that sounds like a tough situation, especially when he is saying that you are not worth the stress. it's not just your self worth. i would say that you should be proud of yourself for doing what you are doing.

[Affirmation and Reassurance] that sounds like a difficult situation to be in.
[Providing Suggestions] it sounds like you are trying to be supportive, but you are also not listening to the right people.
[Questions] does she live in another area that has similar relationships?
[Reflection of feelings] i'm really sorry to hear that. yes, i have. i've had a similar situation.
[Self-disclosure] i just found a good support system online. i found out that i could be there to support my mental health if it meant that i was able to help. i was very supportive of the person who was doing the support and i helped them learn to cope better with their condition.
[Other] yes, that would be a great idea.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] that's great that you are willing to do that.
[Providing Suggestions] do you live alone or have anyone in your life that you can talk to about this?
[Self-disclosure] i have been through a lot of stress as well, but i know it has helped me.

[Reflection of feelings] that is a long time to be there!

[Restatement or Paraphrasing] oh no, that is really bad. i am so sorry to hear that. have you tried talking to them about it?
[Reflection of feelings] i can understand why that would be frustrating for you. i have had to deal with some similar situations before. i'd suggest talking to your friend about this and try to understand why his friends are upset and how they are acting. if they're having trouble with the way you are, it might be because they are not getting along with their friends. i would suggest that you tell him you're not feeling well and that you are working with him to help you to make the best of this.
[Reflection of feelings] i can understand how frustrating that must be for you. i can tell you are having a hard time dealing with him and he needs to be reminded of that. do you think he may be being more honest with you?
[Questions] what is making you think that he is damaging your reputation?
[Providing Suggestions] it sounds like he is being very stubborn about his boundaries. i would be worried that you are going to have to cut ties with him if he has no respect for you.
[Questions] do you think that the two of you may be able to have a good conversation on the same page, and not be uncomfortable with his actions?
[Reflection of feelings] i would think it would help to bring it up in person and not in a video chat. but i would also consider getting a friend to let you know that your feelings are valid, and that you are not being manipulated.
[Self-disclosure] i have experienced it before with my husband, and i think that it'll make you feel better about yourself. it'd also make you appreciate your partner more.
[Providing Suggestions] have you considered talking to a friend about this issue?
[Questions] do you think that you have an opening to open your mind about these things?

[Reflection of feelings] i've been in that position before and i can tell you that it was very hard to be honest with someone who was cheating on you.
[Affirmation and Reassurance] i can understand how you felt. i have been in similar situations. i know the pain of betrayal.
[Questions] what about your friend? do you think they may be able to help you?
[Affirmation and Reassurance] that is totally understandable. what are you planning to do for her after this?
[Reflection of feelings] i'm sorry to hear that. do you have anyone close by who can help you find out about the situation?
